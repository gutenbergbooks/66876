<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


NEW ACQUAINTANCES</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I like</span> not the maiden, Caleb. No good will
come of taking in this daughter of strange people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy words belie thy kind heart, Sarah. Thou
wert willing to take under our care the child of my
kinsman, even though estranged from his father&#8217;s
house by his marriage. I fear, however,&#8221; and the
man&#8217;s voice was troubled, &#8220;that we shall not be
able to make her happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make her happy!&#8221; broke in the woman&#8217;s indignant
tones. &#8220;I fear that she will not be able to
make herself useful. She hath not so far.&#8221; Then,
more gently, &#8220;Yet is she welcome to all we can do
for her now that she hath no kin save us, but I am
fearful because her mother was of the natives of
Canaan so that she hath not been instructed in the
way of Jehovah. If she should have a wrong influence
over our little Miriam!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman in the doorway glanced over her
shoulder at the scene within the dwelling where an
animated conversation was in progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awake, Judith. I myself have awaked early.
See, the door hath been opened and the fresh morning
breezes blow sweet after the night-time when no
air cometh in at all. Father hath almost finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
leading out the animals. Did they bother thee last
night with their stamping? Peradventure some wild
animal was prowling about outside. Is it not a fine
arrangement to have the mangers built between
their part of the house and ours? And is it not comforting
to know that at night and on stormy days
they are safe under the same roof with us? Art
thou still asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>An older maiden sprang to her feet. &#8220;Who could
sleep through thy chatter, Miriam? Thou makest
more noise than the oxen and the asses and the cow
and the calf all put together.&#8221; But a smile tempered
the severity of the speech.</p>

<p>The younger and smaller maid laughed delightedly
and stooping to the floor began to fold the
thickly padded rug or quilt on which she had slept,
depositing it in a nook in the wall apparently built
for the purpose and keeping up a steady stream of
talk designed to be informing to the new arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;If our olive trees have a good crop this year,
we are going to have curtains to hide the beds. Last
year father built this wooden floor to raise our living
room above the ground where the animals stay.
It is cleaner and dryer now and ants and mice do not
trouble us so much. Thinkest thou not we have a
splendid home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith&#8217;s somewhat cool response caused Miriam
to look at her in hurt surprise. The mother flashed
a reassuring smile from her seat in the doorway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
though never ceasing for a moment her skillful
manipulation of a large sieve. It was tossed and
shaken and every few minutes tilted sideways to
allow a tiny shower of straws and dust to fall upon
the ground. While Miriam took up the beds Judith
was required to assist her aunt in grinding the newly
sieved grain. With a steady, monotonous motion
they worked the wooden handle of the mill back and
forth, back and forth, never hastening but never
stopping until at last the sound of the grinding became
lower and lower and finally ceased, the whole
grains of wheat having been crushed into a coarse
powder between the upper and lower stones of the
mill.</p>

<p>It did not take long for this to be made up into
dough, patted into small, flat cakes, and baked
quickly in the out-of-doors oven made of heated
stones. By ten o&#8217;clock, as was usual in the Land
of Israel, the morning repast was ready: hot bread,
fresh milk, and to-day there were young onions
dipped in salt. Had this been winter instead of
spring, there might have been a handful of raisins
or a few olives or the bread might possibly have been
dipped in grape-syrup. This meal was always relished,
however, for no other would be cooked until
sunset. By the time it was finished the morning
mists had rolled away, the sun had dried up the
heavy dews of the night before, and the distant
fields were calling to the husbandmen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Linking her arm through Judith&#8217;s, Miriam
guided the newcomer through the one long street of
the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast a beautiful name, Judith, almost as
beautiful as thyself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Hittite name, Miriam, what thy people call
&#8216;heathen,&#8217; so it will not recommend me hereabouts,
but thou art named for one of the great women of
thy race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not because she was great,&#8221; was the quick
response, &#8220;but because she was useful and good.
Knowest thou not how she cared for her baby
brother, Moses, when she was just a little maid like
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was cut short by their arrival
at a dwelling from whose open doorway voices
floated out upon the balmy air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy father and I toiling and sacrificing for thee,
our only child, and thou rebelling when we ask for
appreciation and obedience!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another voice, choked with sobs, made answer:
&#8220;Thou didst have no objection to Benjamin until
Abner fancied me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost thou add impudence to stubbornness? It
is well thou hast thy father and me to see that thy
folly doth not ruin thy young life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Catching sight of the two hesitating upon the
threshold, the woman hastened to welcome them,
then turned to the girl she had first addressed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
&#8220;Wipe away thy tears and take thy water jar. See,
Rachel, here is Miriam and her young kinswoman
from the Plain of Sharon, a maiden of thine own
age. Go with them and be diligent in thy task, but
this time next year thy feet will take no such journeys
nor thy hands be so employed, for thou shalt
have servants to do thy bidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman turned to her work and the three girls
proceeded on their way, Miriam walking between
the grief-stricken Rachel and the envious Judith,
seeking to atone for the silence which had fallen
upon each. Thus she began to speak in joyous enthusiasm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that the rains are over for the season,
dost thou notice how sweet is the air? Every breeze
bringeth the mingled scent of wild flowers which
the hand of the Lord hath planted to delight the bees
and us. Even from here we can tell what their
faces will be like when we see them closer: anemones
and poppies and wild tulips and arbutus and
hosts of others. Even at night it is interesting here,
for thou canst not tell whether thou wilt be awakened
by the song of a nightingale or the howling of
a wolf, and in the daytime, see!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a sweep of her arm she indicated the light-green
garden patches and wheat-fields in the valley
below them and the darker green of the olive groves
and patches of oaks and pines nestling among the
rugged gray hills on every side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Neither of the girls commented and Miriam became
silent.</p>

<p>At the foot of the path they were descending Judith
paused to take breath. &#8220;To one who hath but
lately come from the level plain along the seacoast,
the mountains are wearying,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;Why
are thy cities perched upon the hilltops when thou
must grow thy food in the valleys?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Rachel seemed disinclined to talk, Miriam took
it upon herself to answer: &#8220;To be cool in summer
and relieved from danger of flood in winter and
safe from our enemies all the time. Knowest thou
not how often the Syrians have swooped down upon
us, like birds of prey, seeking that wherewith to enrich
themselves?&#8221; Then, in tones of sympathy:
&#8220;The path will not seem so steep when thou art
used to it. For to-day do thou rest here and I will
make two journeys to the spring, one for thee and
one for me. Thou knowest we are commanded by
our Law to be mindful of strangers because our people
were strangers in the Land of Egypt, and I must
remember how lonely I should feel to have to live
where nobody knew or loved me even as thou.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith, deeply touched, was affectionately declining
Miriam&#8217;s offer of rest when a whoop startled
alike the echoes and the girls and the mischievous
face of a boy, somewhat older than Miriam, peeped
from behind a rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nathan!&#8221; The exclamation was full of distress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and Miriam gazed at a shattered water jar at her
feet. &#8220;Knowest thou not that jars cost wheat and
sometimes olives? But,&#8221; soothingly, &#8220;never mind,
the jar is not wasted, for <i>these</i> pieces will make
drinking cups and <i>these</i> will do to carry coals in.
They are splendid sherds. Hast thou noticed, Eli,&#8221;
as a still older lad came hurrying toward them, &#8220;that
no matter what is broken there is always something
left?&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire party was busy picking up bits of pottery
from the path, when a youngish man joined
them, at sight of whom Rachel immediately called
to mind an errand elsewhere and, with a whispered
explanation to Miriam, promptly disappeared.
While the newcomer was apparently known to the
younger girl, her face did not light up with pleasure,
although he addressed her gently.</p>

<p>Were they bound for the spring? He was going
in the same direction. He had not met Judith before.
So she was Miriam&#8217;s kinswoman from the
Plain of Sharon where the roses grow. Then
Sharon had sent her most beautiful rose to bloom
near the Jordan! And these lads, he ought to know
them. Fine, sturdy boys. Ah, Hannah&#8217;s children.
He believed that they and their mother lived on a
bit of his land. He had the pleasure, now and then,
of doing them little favors. Of course he knew
them, should probably know them better as time
went on. Lads of excellent qualities indeed!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>His soft voice trailed on and on. After the manner
of the Orient, the man and bays walked ahead,
the girls following.</p>

<p>So, thought Judith, this was Abner, the rich
suitor for Rachel&#8217;s unwilling hand and she (Judith)
the unwanted guest in an irksome home. If only
their places might be reversed! But no hint of inward
agitation appeared in her outward manner,
nor, when the awe with which the boys had first regarded
the newcomer had gradually changed into
friendliness and the elder of the two had been beguiled
into telling an original story, did she appear
to do aught but listen.</p>

<p>He cast it in the form of a fable, after the manner
of the young theological students of the day, the
&#8220;Sons of the Prophet,&#8221; among whom his father
had been numbered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Once there was a young ant who lived with a
large colony of its relatives in the clean, warm
earth. It had everything to make it happy, a good
home and abundance of food, yet was it wroth, for
its elders required it to work. &#8216;Come,&#8217; said they,
&#8216;lend thy strength to the task of carrying home this
grain that we may live and not die when the wet
winter sets in and there is no food to be had.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This little ant, however, who had never seen
a wet winter, was rebellious and ran off to hide
and sulk. Soon it saw a strange sight: men digging
great holes in the fields and coating the floor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
walls with a white substance. With his curiosity
aroused, he went back to the spot day after day until
the sun came out with great heat, the harvest passed
and the threshed and winnowed grain was carefully
stored in these underground chambers, the
cavities being closed in such a way that thieves
could not readily discover its hiding place.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah,&#8217; said the ant, &#8216;here is my opportunity.
Once inside such a place as that, I should have no
fear of cold or hunger, such as my elders are always
trying to guard against. Naught would I have to do
but eat, sleep and grow fat. Then should I be happy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forthwith he watched his chance and slipped
into a little opening just before the workmen closed
it. Alas for his expectations, however, for where
moth and rust could not flourish neither could an
ant. In the stifling atmosphere he began to grow
faint. Tortured in body with this nauseating sickness
and in mind with the thought that he had
brought all this trouble upon himself by his sloth
and selfishness, he finally expired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam, who had listened with rapt attention, now
beamed upon Judith, who stifled a yawn. The next
instant she clutched the younger maid&#8217;s arm. &#8220;See,
Miriam, the little gorge below us is filled with innumerable
gray shapes, and from the sound of a
reed flute which ascends to us I perceive that it is
a shepherd with his flock.&#8221;</p>

<p>They came nearer the objects pointed out. Miriam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
gave one look and a joyous little cry: &#8220;It can be no
other than my brother, Benjamin, whom thou hast
not met before, Judith. He giveth my father&#8217;s
flock a drink below the spring where the water floweth
still and quiet so they will not be frightened. See,
he carrieth a lamb in his bosom. Is it not nice that
men wear such long, loose garments belted in at
the waist, so they can gather the fullness together
wherewith to carry things?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time they were near enough for greetings.
Miriam bounded forward with an eager salutation
for Benjamin and much compassion for the lamb.
&#8220;See, Judith, it is all torn and bleeding, but its good
shepherd hath anointed its wounds with oil and
even put some on its head to comfort and refresh
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith listened and smiled. From under lids discreetly
lowered she was conscious that both the
very young man and the older one were stealing
glances of approval at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peradventure,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;it may not be so
uninteresting here after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abner also listened and smiled, making mental
calculations. As he moved away there was on his
face a look of resolution. &#8220;Why not?&#8221; he communed
with himself. &#8220;Fine lads both and can
become useful. The younger and sturdier can care
for the young of the flock while my shepherds take
their mothers out to graze. The elder hath a remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
mind, coming as he doth of a family
which combineth Israel&#8217;s piety and culture. He can
be trained as a clerk. There is trading to be done
and accounts to be kept. It should be regarded as
a kindness to their mother. Let me see, how much
doth she owe me? Yea, enough and more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sarah had observed with surprise
Rachel&#8217;s hasty return and now watched with some
anxiety for Miriam and Judith.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell thee, Caleb, friendship with a heathen bodeth
no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, Sarah, no harm can come from caring
for the orphan and the needy as we are commanded
in our Law,&#8221; and the man&#8217;s voice was almost harsh
in its reproof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seemeth to me it might depend somewhat upon
the orphan,&#8221; murmured the woman, softly, &#8220;and
my heart hath been strangely heavy since I first beheld
this maiden.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


SURPRISES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Caleb&#8217;s</span> face expressed entire approval as he
looked after Judith, disappearing down the hill.
&#8220;Thou seest, Sarah, that all this poor child needed
was instruction in the way of righteousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And firmness to see that she walketh therein,&#8221;
put in the wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she hath a willing mind, Sarah. Hast thou
not noticed how, of late, she needeth no second
bidding to go to the spring? She doth not even wait
for Miriam to help; she watcheth to see when the
jars need refilling and seeth to them most diligently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; was the response, &#8220;and I have wondered
what&mdash;&#8221; but Caleb, sighing, was already taking his
way to the valley as Judith neared the spring.</p>

<p>A little smile played about her lips. &#8220;How strange
it is,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;that Benjamin&#8217;s sheep need a
drink of water and our jars must be refilled at exactly
the same time every day!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that very moment Rachel, with a tiny reed basket
of bread on her arm, started in the same direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I <i>should</i> see him while I feed the pigeons,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
her face was rosy red, &#8220;and he <i>might</i> be somewhere
near, although, of course, if I knew for certain I
could not be so bold as to be there too&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She entered a little gulch whose narrow walls
constantly widened as one neared the spring. The
air was sweet with aromatic shrubs. A bird hidden
somewhere seemed about to burst its throat with
melody. Insects buzzed a little song of content. As
the girl appeared, a flock of wild pigeons rose from
various resting places and circled around her with
the familiarity of old friendship. Her thoughts,
however, were elsewhere. Peeping through the
bushes, she had seen Benjamin and Judith, laughing
and talking together with all too evident enjoyment.
For a moment&mdash;or was it several?&mdash;she seemed
rooted to the spot with surprise, then, sick at heart,
she had dropped down upon the coarse, green grass,
grateful for the overhanging rocks and bushes which
gave her safe concealment.</p>

<p>To think of Benjamin, who had never cared for
any maid but herself! They had been childish
sweethearts. Around her neck at this very instant
was suspended from a grass-woven chain a bracelet
of dried grasses which he had given her once
when they played at a wedding. In a thousand ways
since then and with a tenderness she could not
doubt he had told her of his love. Had he not desired
Caleb, his father, to ask her parents&#8217; consent
to their marriage? True it had been refused, Abner&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
proposal having been received unexpectedly a
day or so earlier, yet she and Benjamin had hoped
against hope, and now&mdash;</p>

<p>But the pigeons were insistent. They pecked from
her basket. They alighted upon her shoulders.
They watched for the customary open handful of
crumbs from which to eat. Mechanically, since they
would not be denied, she fed them. Abner, passing
along the brow of the hill, saw both tableaux. He
stopped, looked, and passed on, pondering deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel is the gentler, the sweeter,&#8221; he said to
himself, &#8220;but this maid from Sharon is likewise
pleasing. I wonder! Yea, I wonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little while Judith started homeward, the
smile still lingering. &#8220;What a frank, winning boy!&#8221;
she meditated, &#8220;and not unambitious, either, but I do
not envy his charming Rachel the hard work and
self-denial she will have as a shepherd&#8217;s wife.
Strange how she turneth from this man Abner, who
hath treasures of oil and wine and grain; who hath
men servants and maid servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and gazed over field after field of
barley and wheat, now almost ready for the harvest.
&#8220;Had I but her opportunity!&#8221; She stamped her
sandaled foot to the great peril of the water jar and
its precious contents, but her rage soon spent itself
and she became thoughtful. At last she drew a
deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she asked herself. &#8220;Of course an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Eastern woman may not decide whom she will
marry, but there is no reason why she should not
try to influence her fate somewhat,&#8221; and, quite calm
again, even elated, she turned her face toward the
home she found so irksome.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she passed when two young men
crossed hastily the well-worn path and started to
descend the steep sides of the gulch. Suddenly one
placed a detaining hand on the other&#8217;s arm and they
dropped down behind a sheltering bush, peering out
and speaking guardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seest thou anything, Isaac?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naught do I see, Lemuel, but what one is apt to
behold all the way from the Dead Sea to Damascus:
a romantic little gorge and a pretty maiden feeding
some wild pigeons. I thought thou hadst discovered
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion regarded him with amusement.
&#8220;Something thou meanest, Isaac, to breed distrust
or caution or care, whereas the &#8216;something&#8217; was only
satisfactory. Much hast thou to learn, or peradventure
thou art over-fastidious. Knowest thou not
that women were made to delight the hearts of men&mdash;that
is, as long as they keep their youth and their
faith in us, which is not long at the best&mdash;and that
our journey hath been singularly barren of such interests
as lovely maidens far from home?&#8221;</p>

<p>The information was received coldly. &#8220;Far from
home, Lemuel, but not far from what, in this mountainous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
land, they call a &#8216;road,&#8217; and not far from her
city&#8217;s supply of water. This gorge doubtless containeth
a spring or stream. As thou art aware, they
have wells only in the lowlands. The maiden is
therefore not far from protection even if <i>I</i> were
absent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other laughed sneeringly. &#8220;Thy bravery and
thine honor doeth credit to thine house. Peradventure
it will purchase thee promotion. It shall be
reported to my lord N-a-a-m-m-m.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hand was placed firmly over his mouth. &#8220;Thy
indiscretion will spoil our errand, which shall also
be reported and to the same source.&#8221;</p>

<p>A not unmusical cry came echoing down the glen:
&#8220;R- a- c- h- e- l.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl with her head in her hands neither moved
nor answered, but in a moment Miriam&#8217;s face peeped
through the foliage and lighted up with relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everywhere have I searched for thee, Rachel,
and Eli hath helped. He hath a new story, a splendid
one. Dost thou not want to hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel gave a half-hearted assent and the two
new arrivals threw themselves on the coarse green
grass near Rachel, while Eli, smiling in response to
Miriam&#8217;s eager encouragement, began the story she
considered so wonderful:</p>

<p>&#8220;Once there was a cave which the hand of God
had hollowed out of the limestone hills and in front
of which he planted bushes to hide its mouth. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
first the cave was happy enough, but after awhile it
became envious of those in less lonely situations.
Right in the midst of its discontent, however, along
came a leopard who was pleased with this retired
spot and brought up a family here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next, there arrived a band of robbers who slew
the wild animals and deposited themselves and their
ill-gotten gains in the cave, hiding by day and sallying
forth at night. At last some of the thieves were
slain in a battle with honest travelers and the rest
of the band fled.</p>

<p>&#8220;From that time on the cave-dwellers were of a
better class. It became the abode of the hunted and
oppressed. Our father David once took refuge
here from the fury of King Saul, and many a
troubled soul afterward, including the Man of God,
Elijah. But its greatest usefulness came when
Queen Jezebel established Baal-worship as the court
religion of Israel and persecuted the prophets of the
Lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this time Obadiah, the mayor of King Ahab&#8217;s
court, hid herein fifty of the hundred prophets he
saved from the queen&#8217;s vengeance, the cave being
very commodious. Hereafter it was known as &#8216;the
prophet&#8217;s cave,&#8217; and of late years shepherds have
kept provender always on hand so they may resort
hither with their flocks when winter storms drive
them from the hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day the cave, with the wisdom of years, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
reviewing its history. &#8216;How foolish was I and ignorant,&#8217;
it thought, &#8216;to be dissatisfied with the place
Jehovah had appointed me when I should not have
been nearly so useful had I been on the highway,
where I would have chosen to be.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The tale ended, Rachel praised it faintly, but the
younger girl beamed delighted appreciation, watching
Eli&#8217;s departing figure as long as she could see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doth he not make thee feel as if thou wert
standing up on tiptoe all inside, Rachel?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;Some day he is going to learn to read
and write and become learned in the Law, as was
his father, and go about the country teaching and
prophesying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel put a hand to her head. &#8220;Let us go home,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I feel weak and ill. Peradventure it is
the summer heat which hath come on so suddenly.&#8221;
She staggered to her feet.</p>

<p>Miriam, at once all sympathy, put an arm around
her friend&#8217;s waist and they took the steep path out
of the gorge, the pigeons still circling around the
empty basket. Only once did the smaller maid speak
and that was just as they came opposite the hiding
place of the two strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou knowest, Rachel, that Eli&#8217;s tale was a true
one, being of our own prophet&#8217;s cave here in this
very glen, thirty paces beyond the fallen sycamore
tree, its mouth hidden by the sumac bushes. Thou
wilt remember how oft we have been there.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Rachel murmured an assent and they moved out
of sight and hearing. The young men rose from
their cramped positions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very place, Lemuel, thanks to our small
friend, though she knew not whom she was befriending.
This night shall we abide there and
mark the spot for future need. This is a rich little
valley. To-morrow we separate, each taking the
way determined aforetime,&#8221; and with swift steps
they proceeded in the direction Miriam had indicated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The perfumed breath of May lost its elusive
sweetness and became burdened with the heat of
June. The evening meal was over and the last faint
radiance of sunset was swallowed up in darkness.
Caleb closed and barred the heavy door against the
summer breezes and the family spread their sleeping
mats in preparation for rest.</p>

<p>Judith yawned audibly. &#8220;So glad am I that this
tiresome day hath drawn to a close.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was scandalized. &#8220;Glad that the Sabbath
is over? And soon after sunrise one of the Sons of
the Prophet came to instruct the city in the ways
of Jehovah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; insisted Judith, &#8220;I like not that long-haired
Order of wayside preachers who shout and denounce
and talk mysteries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb felt it his duty to impart information.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
&#8220;Alas, the sacred Order is not what it was before
King Ahab took unto himself the foreign Queen,
Jezebel. A fine soldier and statesman was Ahab,
and I doubt not he believed he benefited Israel by
his alliance with our more cultured and enterprising
neighbors, the Ph&#339;nicians. He thought much about
the advantages of trade, as shown by his treaty with
Ben-hadad, the Syrian king, whereby the merchants
of Israel now have their own street in Damascus, the
great capital city of Syria.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many good qualities had King Ahab, but a sorry
day it was for Israel&#8217;s religion when he allowed
Queen Jezebel a free hand to spread Baal-worship,
even to the persecution of the prophets of the Lord.
Hundreds were put to death; many fled to more
peaceful homes, such as Egypt, and others still
bowed the knee, not so much to the hated Baal as to
the strong authority of the court. Fear threatened
to destroy all that was purest and best in the land,
but the Lord of Hosts hearkened to the distress of
his people and granted deliverance by his prophet
Elijah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since then, and especially in these later years
under Elijah&#8217;s successor, Elisha, the prophetic
Guilds have been revived in the hope of spreading
piety and some degree of learning among the people
at large; they who have been exposed for so long
to the pernicious teachings of the priests of Baal,
as encouraged by that wicked woman, Jezebel.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;But truly the service of Baal is much more joyous
than thy worship of Jehovah with all thy strict
observances and commandments,&#8221; said Judith,
earnestly, &#8220;and why call Queen Jezebel &#8216;wicked&#8217;?
It was but courteous to a foreigner to allow her to
bring her own religion into her new home, and naturally
she was anxious to spread the teachings in
which she believed.&#8221;</p>

<p>In tones whose sternness was softened by pity,
Caleb bade her hush. &#8220;Thou knowest not what thou
sayest. The &#8216;wicked,&#8217; through the pride of his heart,
will not seek after the one true God. They care
not to know the Law by which we, his chosen, are
warned and in keeping of which there is great reward.
It is well that thou shouldst understand
clearly&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A hubbub outside claimed attention. Faintly at
first, and then nearer and nearer until it halted outside
the very door, came the yelping and barking of
dogs mingled with the sound of running footsteps,
and voices.</p>

<p>Miriam crept to Sarah&#8217;s outstretched arms. &#8220;O
mother,&#8221; in a frightened whisper, &#8220;thinkest thou the
Syrians be upon us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother held her close. Caleb snatched up the
goad ordinarily used for driving oxen, the sharply
pointed end of which made a formidable weapon.
From the darkness came a sound of labored breathing
and a woman&#8217;s sobbing cry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;Open, Caleb. It is only I, Hannah, and my
children, Eli and Nathan, and the dogs rend us.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the door was thrown open to admit them she
cried, mournfully, &#8220;Peace, peace be to thy home,
though there be none in mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was almost incoherent with grief. &#8220;The word
came to me but a little while before the Sabbath and
I waited until the passing of the holy day to hurry
to thee, my friends. The dogs mistook us for foes
and pursued. In the darkness we stumbled oft and
fell. Yea, we are bruised, but our bodies are less sore
than our hearts, for Abner, my creditor, taketh my
two sons, Eli and Nathan, to be bondmen for debt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since my widowhood have I lived on his land.
Oft hath he brought us food. Once, twice, thrice
have I borrowed of him, so kind hath he seemed.
Always he urged me to take more and yet more than
I asked. Never once hath this shame seemed possible.
Let us kneel in supplication to the God of
our fathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, Hannah, and I doubt not he will hear and
answer. Abide thou with us for a time and to-morrow
we will see if aught can be done.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


VISITORS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the peaceful Israelitish hills came the piping
of a reed flute. Anyone familiar with the country
would know that it was a shepherd, seeking to assure
the flock of his continued presence that they
might fear no evil, but to the young man, scarcely
more than a boy, lying prone on his back in the shade
of the bushes, it conveyed nothing at all, yet it was
the only sound which persisted in his consciousness.
He lived by it as much as did the sheep and goats.
When the tune was blithe he saw sunlit fields and
abundant harvests; shaded glens and cool, gurgling
streams; a palace and a soldiers&#8217; barracks; the face
of an old, bedridden woman and a delicately pretty
girl feeding pigeons in a romantic spot. When the
notes were sad&mdash;as they frequently were&mdash;he defended
this maid from some grave peril in which
the odds were all against him.</p>

<p>There came a day, however, when he no longer
raved in delirium, but looked upon his surroundings
with recognition in his eyes. He tried to sit up, to
reach a little water-bag that looked cool and comforting,
but finding himself weighted down with a
strange heaviness, contented himself with gazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
around wonderingly. The sky seemed so near. No,
it was not the sky. It was a covering of skins sewed
together and stretched from one bush to another
over him. Nothing else save the interminable flute
which told his newly awakened senses that the shepherd
was near. It was all so soothing, just lying
there, and he was so unexpectedly weak, that he
closed his eyes and sank into a deep and refreshing
slumber.</p>

<p>When he awoke the canopy over his head had been
removed and he gazed at the brilliant stars. Looking
around, he decided that he must be inside of a sheepfold.
By the moonlight he discerned roughly built
stone walls on four sides. The open entrance was
guarded by a recumbent shepherd, staff in hand,
alert, watchful. One, two, three other figures he
counted, evidently sleeping heavily beside great gray
masses which he knew must be sheep. All at once
a scream pierced the silence, a hideous, unearthly
sound, and then a long, lithe body leaped over the
wall.</p>

<p>The young man who observed these things knew
instinctively that it was a mountain lion, tempted
far from its rocky lair by hunger. He knew that the
shepherds, instantly awakened, would give battle,
and that they would be more than a match for any
wild animal in search of food, but a sense of his own
helplessness swept over him. He saw the terror of
the sheep, the mangled body of a victim, heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
cry of its mother, and then a great wave of sickness
shut out sight and sound. He had fainted from
sheer weakness.</p>

<p>A little later he opened his eyes upon the troubled
face of the shepherd&mdash;<i>his</i> shepherd, as he soon
learned to call him in distinction from the others,
who paid him but scant attention. It was a kindly,
pleasant face, over-thoughtful perhaps but with
health and youth written large under its tan. In
the days that followed, the invalid found himself
grasping at the strength and energy radiated by this
personality, basking in his sunny smile, entertained
and quite frequently instructed by his conversation,
cheered and encouraged by his practical helpfulness.</p>

<p>If, however, the convalescent was pleased with
the shepherd, how much more was the shepherd
pleased with the convalescent! Moved at first merely
by motives of pity and generosity, he soon took a
delight in the presence of the stranger which was
wholly inexplicable to himself. He had never met
anyone&mdash;at least not a very young man like himself&mdash;who
possessed such a fund of general information
and seemed to have such mature judgment. He
talked as one who had lived in cities and associated
with those who had seen much of that world which
was new and strange to this mountain lad who had
spent his eager, responsive youth hand-in-hand with
Toil and Responsibility, as youth often does in the
East.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>One day, under the shadow of a great rock which
shielded them from the heat of the midsummer sun,
they were talking. &#8220;How long sayest thou I have
been here, Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is eight weeks, Isaac, since I found thee under
the bushes yonder, sick with fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then eight weeks hast thou cared for me, night
and day. How knewest thou that I was not a robber,
or, worse still, what thy countrymen despise
most, a Syrian spy?&#8221; The tone was careless and
breathed a laugh, but the speaker glanced searchingly
at his companion, who, after a moment&#8217;s silence, replied
quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped but to consider thy pressing need, Isaac,
for our Law commandeth us to regard the necessity
of the stranger, but if I had thought further, the
pack on thy back would have proclaimed thee a peddler,
though thy stock be small. Likewise, thy pronunciation
showeth that our tongue is native to
thee and thou hast an Israelitish name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac sighed and there sounded in it something of
relief. &#8220;My mother was of thy nation,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;a captive in Syria, where she married my
father, who was of Egyptian blood and a servant
in the same house with herself. I am named for
some of her people and she spoke to me always in
her own language.&#8221; Then, hastily, as if he feared
questions: &#8220;But for thee I might have died, an
awful, burning death here in the wilderness, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
even a drink of cold water to allay my thirst or a
friend to save my body from the vultures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think not of it, Isaac. It is only thy departure
on the morrow which saddeneth me. Caring for
thee was as balm to a sore heart, better than all the
aromatic herbs in Gilead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac looked questioningly: &#8220;A woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd assented. &#8220;From childhood have
I had no thought save <i>of</i> her and <i>for</i> her. When I
could make her a home, I desired my father to ask
her in marriage of her parents, as is our custom. At
first they were willing, as I had believed, but their
consent was refused, the maiden being pleasing to a
man of greater means. Yet was she true to me. I
had it from her own lips and through the mouth of
my little sister, Miriam, of whom I have before
spoken to thee. All at once the maiden changed.
Deaf, dumb, and blind did she become to all that
concerned me, and when I would see her they said
she was sick, which I cannot believe, and I had to
come away without a word of explanation. It
troubleth me.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Isaac, more worldly wise, the reason was
plain. &#8220;She favoreth the other,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and thou
shouldst not cherish the memory of one who hath
treated thee with contempt. Canst thou not think
of someone else, Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd laughed in a mirthless way. &#8220;None
to fill her place, Isaac; nor is it of another she thinketh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Nay! One there was who always appeared at
the spring when I was waiting for my beloved. She
was a clever, amusing maid, but a life with her
would be like living on honey without any bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac nodded in comprehension. &#8220;The same have
I felt toward all the maidens I ever met save one.
Once, as I traveled with my pack, I was able to avert
a danger she knew not of, and her face hath been
in my memory ever since. I have not wished to
dislodge it. She fed wild pigeons, I recall, in a romantic
little gorge.&#8221;</p>

<p>A silence fell between them, each, with fine feeling,
unwilling to ask for details not volunteered.</p>

<p>The next day, at parting, Isaac took from his own
arm a heavy bracelet of gold and clasped it around
Benjamin&#8217;s. &#8220;Not for its value,&#8221; he insisted, when
the shepherd demurred, &#8220;but as a covenant of lasting
friendship &#8217;twixt thee and me. As thou hast saved
my life so doth it belong to thee or thine if in aught
I can ever serve thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next minute Benjamin was alone. At the
turn of the road Isaac looked back and waved his
hand in farewell and the shepherd, with a sigh,
turned to his sheep and his constant thoughts of
Rachel. He did not know that at that very hour
events of considerable importance to both of them
were taking place in the little &#8220;city&#8221; of their nativity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Noontime, whose brightness had no power to dispel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the sorrow which hung over Caleb&#8217;s household,
saw Judith slipping, with a shudder, out of its
gloomy portal. Abner was coming up the hill as she
started to descend it. She answered his pleasant
greeting with assumed diffidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hasten, my lord, desiring to spend a time with
Rachel, who, as thou knowest, hath spent these
eight weeks and more in the house and mostly on
her bed, suffering from a mysterious sickness none
dareth yet to name. Save that she hath long been
secretly betrothed to my kinsman, Benjamin, who
taketh his sheep to the hills, we know not where, and
that her parents are very wroth&mdash;yet because thou
hast looked with favor upon the maid would I
warn thee&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank thee,&#8221; he said, slowly, his face somewhat
paler than usual, and the two hurried their separate
ways.</p>

<p>In strange contradiction to such solicitude, however,
Judith did not visit Rachel. She rarely did.
It was Miriam who sat by her friend&#8217;s side telling
her of Hannah&#8217;s plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not enough grain and olive oil in the
whole city to satisfy Abner&#8217;s claim and save Eli and
Nathan from bondage, nor will he wait for the next
barley and wheat to be harvested. As for grapes and
olives, they will not be ripe for months. Father hath
tried to shame Abner, but he saith he is grieved to be
so misunderstood; that Hannah should be grateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to him for taking upon himself the burden of her
sons&#8217; support.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently, Rachel was not in a mood for conversation.
The younger girl gazed at her in great
dejection for a few minutes and a tear splashed down
on her hand. &#8220;It would be easier to bear other people&#8217;s
troubles, Rachel, if one could help. I am going
to bathe thy feverish face and hands and take down
thy hair. Thou shalt hold the little mirror of polished
bronze that Ezekiel, thy kinsman in Damascus,
sent thee.&#8221; Suiting the action to the word she went
on talking: &#8220;Damascus must be a very great city,
peradventure almost twice as large as ours. Father
hath told me about the war between Israel and Syria
and the treaty of peace, so that Syrian merchants
may come to Israel and a street hath been set aside
in Damascus in which our people may dwell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel seemed to take no more interest in foreign
affairs than in those at home, but the little maid was
not discouraged. &#8220;Thou art more comfortable now.
Thou hast been sick ever since that day the heat
overcame thee in the gorge when thou wert feeding
the pigeons, but thou dost not have to go on being
miserable. Thou knowest, the Lord is thy strength
and song. I am going to see how Hannah doeth
and remind her of this. She abode with us through
the night, but now she is in her own house. First,
though, I shall sing thee to sleep. Thou seest I have
brought my timbrel. Then will I steal softly away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Having made good her word, Miriam was about
to depart when the kindly voice of Rachel&#8217;s mother
detained her: &#8220;Stay, Miriam, yet a moment and
take to Hannah this little pot of oil. The gift is not
much to her that dwelleth in the house of sorrow, but
it carrieth a message of sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halfway to her destination Miriam met Judith.
&#8220;I have been seeking for thee,&#8221; said the older girl.
&#8220;Knowest thou that we have a guest, a man? He
hath come from a distance in the heat and dust, and
I have been to draw cool, fresh water wherewith
to bathe his hands and feet and so refresh him
while thy mother prepareth a meal to set before
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam hazarded a few guesses as to the identity
of their visitor, but Judith shook her head. &#8220;It is
none whom thou hast mentioned, but who it is I
know not. He weareth a mantle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he is one of the prophets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, for he is bald and the prophets wear long
hair. Neither hath he the appearance of a fanatic,
as do they. Rather, he seemeth like some well-to-do
man of the cities, peradventure a merchant. His
speech is gracious and gentle and he carrieth a walking
stick like any serious-minded, elderly gentleman.
He is attended by a younger man and thy father
did him great obeisance. Also&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Judith was alone. Miriam was running like
some wild thing straight to Hannah&#8217;s house. Out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of breath she stumbled over the threshold and thrust
the pot of oil into the woman&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hannah&mdash;Hannah&mdash;the Man of God hath come,
my lord Elisha, and even now sitteth at meat in our
house. Do thou go quickly. Thy husband was of
his young men. Do thou tell him about Abner taking
Eli and Nathan as bondmen for debt. Jehovah hath
sent him that as God hath been thy strength, he
shall now be thy song. Hasten, Hannah,&#8221; but Hannah
was already gone.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later Miriam, wild with excitement,
paused on the threshold of Rachel&#8217;s house.
Within were voices and while she hesitated as to
whether or not to enter, she heard the message.</p>

<p>Abner had sent his friend, after the manner of
the East, to speak on the subject of his betrothal to
Rachel, not to bring the customary gifts and make
necessary arrangements, but to do the rather unusual
thing: to withdraw his previous proposal on
the plea of her ill-health. The affair was conducted
with elaborate civilities on the part of both the
emissary and Rachel&#8217;s parents, hiding the contempt
of the one and the rage of the other.</p>

<p>It was a very awed little Miriam but one with
shining eyes who held Rachel&#8217;s hand a few minutes
after the messenger had departed. &#8220;Art thou not
glad?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>The older girl nodded slightly, aware of her
mother&#8217;s frown.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;And Benjamin will be so happy,&#8221; Miriam declared,
but Rachel sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinketh no more upon me,&#8221; she said, and refused
to be comforted.</p>

<p>The general gloom of the household was soon
overborne, however, by the tidings Miriam had
brought. At the feet of the prophet Hannah had
knelt in supplication and he had had compassion
upon her distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;At his command,&#8221; recited Miriam, joyfully, &#8220;we
borrowed from our neighbors all the empty vessels
possible, then she and Eli and Nathan went into
their own house and shut the door. Eli told me what
happened. <i>From the little pot of oil thy mother sent
by me, Hannah filled all those vessels!</i> Then came
she again to the Man of God, who was still in our
house, and he instructed her what next to do. Now
she hath gone to sell the oil and pay Abner. Yet will
there be something left, for I heard my lord Elisha
say unto her, &#8216;Live thou and thy children <i>of the
rest</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>When the happy comments had died away Miriam
stroked her friend&#8217;s hair. &#8220;Why dost thou not ask
to be healed, Rachel? Let us go to the Man of
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Rachel shook her head. &#8220;I must not ask for
what I do not want, Miriam, and when Benjamin
no longer thinketh upon me, why should I desire to
get well?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


CAPTIVES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Autumn</span> had come to the Land of Israel. The
sun had just lifted a shining face, but in more than
one city the inhabitants had been long astir. Before
all the more important abodes stood asses, saddled
and laden with water-skin and leather provision bag
as if for a journey. In a little while could be seen
broken lines of riders, singly or in groups, wending
their way in slow and dignified fashion on these
same sure-footed animals, over the narrow threads
of rocky roads which traversed hill and vale. All
faces were turned in one direction&mdash;Jerusalem. The
master of the house was on his way to the Feast of
Tabernacles, or the Feast of the Ingathering, as it
was sometimes called.</p>

<p>The air had in it a hint of frost, being too chill
for rain, but nobody minded, certainly not a misty-eyed
little maid who was walking with her two travelers
to the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe thou art glad to see us go, Miriam,&#8221;
said Caleb, teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very glad, father. It is right thou shouldst
appear before the Lord with thine offerings, for he
hath dealt bountifully with us, and I am glad thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
canst take mother to visit her kindred. Long hath
it been since she hath seen them, and it will make
her so happy, but&#8221;&mdash;the voice trembled a little&mdash;&#8220;I
would be gladder if this were the day thou wert
coming home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her parents exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou knowest that the olive trees had a good
crop and the vineyard. Likewise the flock hath been
profitable and thou art thinking of the nose-ring we
shall bring thee, or was it anklets thou didst choose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much more concerned as to her conduct,
Caleb, than I am as to her ornaments,&#8221; put in Sarah,
hastily. &#8220;Remember, Miriam, I shall expect thee
to behave thyself wisely, in a perfect way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, mother, but when thou and father art gone,
how will I know what is wise and perfect?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah regarded her severely. &#8220;The Law of the
Lord is perfect. See that thou keep it. The testimony
of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
Remember it. The commandment of the Lord is
right, enlightening the eyes. Meditate upon it.
There is no chance for a mistake if God is in all
thy thoughts. Miriam, wilt thou keep the Lord
alway before thy face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thou wilt not be turned aside to the right
hand nor to the left, no matter what influence is
brought to bear upon thee?&#8221; Sarah glanced apprehensively
back at Judith, standing in the open door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;Nay, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to the place of parting, Caleb
walking ahead, leading the two asses. Judith could
not hear what was said, but she could see that the
farewells were lingering and affectionate. A great
wave of longing for her own parents swept over her
and she turned into the house to avoid the unsympathetic
and the curious. She did not know, therefore,
that when the travelers were quite hidden from
sight in the distance, Miriam sank upon the ground
in a little heap of wretchedness.</p>

<p>Neither did Judith nor anyone else guess that at
that very moment the mother was nervously fingering
the bridle of her beast. &#8220;Long have I wanted to
take this journey, Caleb, but it were easier to talk of
than to do. I will go back. I cannot leave the little
maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Sarah,&#8221; and a stranger would have
noticed that Caleb&#8217;s voice was none too steady, although
he affected cheerfulness. &#8220;It will do thee
much good to have a visit among thy kindred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But thinkest thou all will go well while we are
away?&#8221; Sarah was still hesitant.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could they go ill with Hannah to stay with
Miriam and Judith, and Eli and Nathan to see to
the animals? Besides, we shall be gone but a few
days. They will be sorry to see us return, for youth
joyeth with youth. Mount, I pray thee, and let us
be going, for our pace will be slow at the best.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Reluctantly she yielded to his entreaties, but with
many a backward glance and an anxiety which
seemed wholly unwarranted.</p>

<p>Along the path they had just traversed came Rachel
and gathered Miriam in her arms. &#8220;I feared to
find thee so, little maid,&#8221; she comforted. &#8220;Nay,&#8221;
compassionately, &#8220;thou must not weep. And if thou
wilt dry thine eyes I will tell thee a secret so dear
it hath not been whispered before.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a rosy and radiant Rachel who was speaking
now. &#8220;Knowest thou that when Benjamin came
home a few days ago he told me something that
made me very happy? And when he cometh next
time we are to be publicly betrothed. My parents
have consented and I have my wedding veil. We
must go back to thy dwelling now, but some day,
when there is none to see but thee, I shall try it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised the limp figure and, talking of the future
to divert the thoughts of her grief-stricken little
friend, guided her along the well-known path toward
home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At about the same hour, somewhere out on the
Israelitish hills, a shepherd was leading his flock
northward under pressure of military escort. His
face was sullen, but all at once he laughed: &#8220;It
took three and more coming to take captive one shepherd
of Israel. These Syrian dogs!&#8221; He laughed
again, contemptuously. The soldier nearest, understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the intent if not the words, struck him with
the broadside of his short sword, and the shepherd
laughed no more.</p>

<p>The monotony of merely going forward was relieved
a little later by the passing of a band of horsemen,
coming south. The shepherd listened apathetically
to what was evidently, although he understood
not a word, an exchange of civilities and compliments
upon the capture of so large and fine a flock.
He glanced carelessly at the gayly bedecked horse of
the leader and then at the man himself. It was a
young man, and all at once the shepherd&#8217;s indifference
vanished. He had the face of a friend! Undoubtedly
he and his flock would soon be free.</p>

<p>Running forward quickly, he knelt and threw up
one arm, exposing to view a broad gold bracelet of
exquisite design, by that movement plainly seeking
recognition. The young officer appeared startled
for an instant, then he assumed an air of unconcern
and with careless farewells to the soldier-escort of
the flock, he and his men rode on.</p>

<p>The shepherd crimsoned at the rebuff. &#8220;I could
swear that were Isaac,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;even to the
pallor of his recent illness. Thus hath he kept his
pledge, a promise he made voluntarily. So would a
viper repay the fool who warmed it by his fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning, he found himself the object of mockery
and ridicule. Unfortunately, he allowed rage to get
the better of discretion. He was captured, but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
conquered. With a swift movement he struck one
of his tormentors a stinging blow full in the face,
but a fellow soldier used his ever ready spear, and
after that, Benjamin the shepherd went his way
limping.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the next day that Miriam was helping Hannah
make butter. That is to say, a goatskin bag,
nearly full of milk, was suspended out of doors from
the center of three crossed poles, and they were shaking
and beating it with great regularity and violence.
In due course of time a product not at all resembling
the butter to which we are accustomed rewarded
their labors. With a sigh, the moist and dripping
bag was carried into the house and hung in the coolest
spot possible that its curdled contents might ferment
and be used, as needed, to give relish to otherwise
dry bread.</p>

<p>The task finished, Hannah betook herself to her
own home to be gone an hour or two. Miriam, left
alone, dropped down in the doorway. All day she
had been unaccountably heavy of spirit, &#8220;not sick,&#8221;
she had told Hannah in answer to a solicitous inquiry,
&#8220;but just not glad of anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was it only yesterday her parents had started on
their journey? It seemed like a week. And what
strange sights they must be seeing now! Very
strange indeed could they have seen through
Miriam&#8217;s eyes, for her thoughts were soon jumbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
by the sprites of Dreamland. When she awoke the
afternoon shadows were lengthening. Hannah had
not returned, and where was Judith? If she were
late, Hannah would be sure to tell father and mother
and they would be displeased. Why did she not
come?</p>

<p>Miriam was dismayed, then came a thought, the
horror of which sent her running to the top of the
hill, where the path began to descend to the valley
below: suppose Judith had been bitten by a viper out
of the brushwood she had gone to gather for fuel!
She was nowhere in sight, although she had been absent
since a little after noon. Slowly Miriam walked
down the hill, gazing long and searchingly in all
directions until she stood in the silence and loneliness
of the deserted fields. How find anybody or
anything among those rank grasses, grown taller
than herself now that the harvests were over? Yet
at that very instant Judith must be lying among them
somewhere, sick perhaps unto death.</p>

<p>Running hither and thither and thoroughly
alarmed, Miriam essayed calling. The third time
her hail was answered, but not in the way she had
expected. Not Judith but Nathan&mdash;Nathan, pale
and frightened; Nathan, entreating her silence but
speaking himself in hoarse, excited whispers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Miriam, the valley is full of soldiers!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was amazed, incredulous, and he indignant
at her unbelief. &#8220;Thinkest thou, Miriam, I know not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
a soldier when I see one?&#8221; he panted as they ran.
&#8220;Was not every man covered from neck to thigh,
back and front, with his breast-plate of bronze
scales? Did not each wear a helmet and carry a
shield on his left arm and a buckler<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> slung from his
girdle? Some had long and heavy spears; some,
bows and arrows and some had slings, with the
stones for them in bags around their necks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Nathan,&#8221; suggested Miriam, weakly, &#8220;peradventure
our king passeth this way with his bodyguard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would our king rob Abner&#8217;s storehouses in the
field? Nay, and these have not Israelitish faces.
Besides, they came on horses which they have left
at the head of the valley, and thou shouldst know
that horses mean war. Canst thou not run faster,
Miriam? We must warn quickly mother and the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little maid&#8217;s face blanched. &#8220;I must find
Judith. Do thou go on and I&mdash;&#8221; Nathan&#8217;s remonstrances
were cut short by the sudden appearance,
out of the tall grass, of a man dressed just as the
lad had described. He laid a detaining hand on each,
addressing them in their own language, but his pronunciation
showed that it was acquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time to-morrow,&#8221; pointing to the village
on the hilltop, &#8220;our archers will have bent their bows
and made ready their arrows and sent fire and destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
into the midst of thy city. None shall be
left alive save such as we take into captivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam wrung her hands and wept, but Nathan
spoke defiantly, with passion in his tones: &#8220;Thou
knowest not that we of Israel, especially we of the
tribe of Zebulon, fight long and hard, jeoparding our
lives unto the death.&#8221;</p>

<p>An evil smile distorted the man&#8217;s features.
&#8220;Thinkest thou we know not that thy men are away
at the feast in Jerusalem? To-morrow this time
thy land shall be desolate from Jerusalem northward,
and we will take captive thy flocks and thy
herds&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was interrupted by the arrival of another
soldier, dressed much the same, but the more
elaborate ornamentation of his shield, and his richly
decorated helmet with its crest, denoted a higher
rank. All this, however, was quite lost upon Nathan
and Miriam. They noted only that he was very
young&mdash;older than Eli, perhaps, but doubtless
younger than Benjamin&mdash;that he bent upon them a
look not in the least malevolent, as was that of their
captor, and that when he spoke to them, also in
their own tongue, his speech was as free from foreign
accent as their own. Apparently, he had authority,
for at a word, the first soldier withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I happened to overhear,&#8221; he told the children.
&#8220;Fear not nor believe what Lemuel hath said. He
was but teasing thee. Our men went no farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
south than the Valley of Jezreel, which is a long way
north of Jerusalem, and we have not come to make
war upon the people but only to take foodstuffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two gazed at him doubtfully. &#8220;Peradventure,&#8221;
sobbed Miriam, &#8220;when thou art asleep the
other soldier will do these terrible things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man laughed, a mirthful laugh. &#8220;Lemuel?
Nay, he could not. We have but a few men
and,&#8221; with some little pride, &#8220;<i>I</i> have been given
charge of this band.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the rapidly declining sun and his
next words were more decisive. &#8220;See, it is almost
sunset. We did not come to take prisoners, but
thou wilt understand that I cannot let thee go home
to give the alarm, and afterward thou wilt prefer
Syria to Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was distressed anew.</p>

<p>The young captain reasoned gently: &#8220;To-night
thy household will think thou art with friends somewhere,
but they cannot seek thee in the darkness,
among the half-wild, scavenger dogs that roam thy
villages at night. By dawn they will have other
matters to engage their attention. Thou wilt go
with me now to our encampment in the gorge by
the spring. Come,&#8221; to Miriam, &#8220;thou shalt have a
corner of the prophet&#8217;s cave all to thyself to-night
with a leopard&#8217;s skin for a covering. Thou wilt
like that, for it was given me by the best man I ever
knew, a shepherd of Israel. And thou,&#8221; turning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Nathan, &#8220;shalt have the opposite corner, but I have
only one leopard skin and that is for the little maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something very attractive, very sincere
in his address. He seemed to understand their terror,
their distrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be not afraid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thou shalt be well
treated. If not, it will be because thou dost not treat
us well. To-night we encamp. To-morrow we start
for Damascus, but thou shalt both have good care
all the way. Isaac pledgeth thee his word!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


JOURNEYING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> dawn came Miriam was in a heavy slumber.
Strange surroundings, terror, and grief had
taken as large a part in keeping her long awake as
her bed on the hard floor or the chill dampness of
the cave. She was still sobbing. The young captain
bent over her pityingly for an instant and
tucked in the leopard&#8217;s skin to keep her warm, then,
leaving a guard at the door, he and the rest of his
men departed upon their errand. When she awoke
she discerned Nathan&#8217;s sullen face in the half light,
and it aroused her to an immediate comprehension
of their plight.</p>

<p>He whispered to her: &#8220;Thinkest thou I shall go
to Damascus a captive? Did the Man of God save
me from bondage in my own country only to go
into worse in a heathen land? Nay, but I shall
escape, and when I am gone be not anxious for me
nor unhappy for thyself. I shall come back to my
mother and Eli, and some day we shall rescue thee.
Do thou put confidence in my words. Look here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bared his arm and shoulder and with gentle
fingers she touched the welts and bruises, exclaiming
compassionately.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>He was still unconquered, defiant. &#8220;The soldiers
gave these to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not when thou wert good and obedient,
Nathan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he admitted, and fell into a shamefaced
silence.</p>

<p>She considered a moment. &#8220;It seemeth to me,
Nathan, there be times when we cannot help what
we do, only <i>how</i> we do. Dost thou not remember
how our father Joseph was sold into bondage in
Egypt? If he had refused to make himself useful
or been unfaithful in his tasks&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan placed his fingers warningly on his lips
and Miriam ceased speaking as the soldiers swarmed
into the cave, so putting an end to conversation.</p>

<p>Breakfast had long been over for the men, but in
the hurry of departure the youthful commander did
not forget a handful of raisins and dried figs, together
with some parched corn, for his small prisoners.
He insisted that they eat, then, taking the
hand of each, they left the prophet&#8217;s cave, turned
their backs upon the gorge, and walked leisurely the
valley road to its head, where the animals awaited
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hast thou ever been on a horse, little maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw one but once. That was when the
king&#8217;s messenger passed this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to set thee in front of me, on my
horse. He will go faster than an ass but not so fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
as a camel at top speed, and in six days, or maybe
seven, we shall be in Damascus. We travel slowly
to accommodate our speed to that of our beasts of
burden, heavily laden with stores from thy rich little
valley. The lad will be on another horse in front
of one of the men, but they are rough and boisterous.
Wouldst thou not rather ride with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for assent he lifted her gently
to the back of the animal, gave a few directions to
his men, and the column began to move. There was
no saddle and she found herself slipping. She
grasped desperately at the horse&#8217;s mane, but Isaac
had anticipated this and held her firmly with one
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be easier when thou art more used to
riding,&#8221; he comforted, &#8220;but I will not let thee fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long, last look at the village on the hillside and
then, with eyes that saw not for tears and a heart
that seemed to weigh much more than her sturdy
little body, Miriam left behind all that was dear to
her and began the journey into a far country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later a maiden climbed slowly and painfully
the steep path up from the valley. At the top
she met a woman with horrible cuts across the face
and body, weak from loss of blood and leaning on
the shoulder of a lad whose right arm hung useless
at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou hurt, Judith?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Nay, Hannah, but if thou hadst fled from one
terror to another ever since yesterday afternoon
when I first beheld the soldiers coming up the valley,
and had finally lain concealed for hours, not
daring to move lest thou be discovered, chilled by
the heavy night dews, stiff and cramped, frightened
and lacking food, thou also wouldst walk with difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli was horrified, reproachful: &#8220;Thou knewest
the Syrians were upon us and madest no effort to
warn the city? We might have put up a better defense
or saved some of our supplies by hiding them.
As it is, many have suffered, a few even unto
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked shudderingly at a swiftly
approaching cloud which darkened the air, then
quickly drew his mother inside the nearest house.
&#8220;The vultures descend, having scented their prey
from afar, yet few were slain and they only because
of desperate resistance. The pale young man, scarce
older than I, who seemed to command the party, had
his men well under control. He reproved the soldier
who smote thee, mother, and stooped over thee with
horror in his eyes, himself tying the cloth which
saved thee from bleeding to death and which I could
not tie with one hand. I could love him were he
other than a heathen and a robber!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to Judith, who had followed them, his
voice became stern: &#8220;Knowest thou that famine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
stareth us in the face&mdash;and thou mightest have saved
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s tones were aggrieved: &#8220;Gladly would
I have borne tidings, Eli, if I could have done so
with safety, but I should have been captured. They
have taken Nathan and Miriam, and a veiled maiden
rideth in the rear who somehow reminded me of
Rachel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hannah clasped Judith&#8217;s arm: &#8220;Thou sawest
Nathan and Miriam? Tell me&mdash;&#8221; and Judith, who
had seen and heard almost everything of the eventful
hours just past, told the story.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Miriam had left the village-crowned
hills, the fertile valleys, the scattered oak groves;
crossed a tree-studded, grassy meadow, a tangle of
ferns and brushwood, and descended a gorge in
the midst of which tumbled and roared and foamed
a stream. The atmosphere seemed heavy with a
heat not derived from the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hast thou seen the Jordan before, little maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her answer was lost in the confusion of fording
the river. At a place sufficiently shallow the horses
were led down the steep and slippery bank, alarmed
the moment their feet rested in the soft mud; terrified
on reaching the shingly bottom to feel the swift
tug of the current and the coldness of the rapid
waters; cold after their enforced dip and taking
quickly and easily the cliffs and steppes to the broad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
plateau above, which seemed the higher because of
the depression of the Jordan Valley. The wind
swept chill out of the snow-covered mountains to the
north, toward which they were turning their faces,
but after the heaviness of the valley they had just
left, the air was exhilarating and fragrant with
herbage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are east of the Jordan now, little maid,&#8221; explained
the young captain. &#8220;Seest thou how much
easier it is to travel? It will be fairly level all
the way into Damascus. Thou wilt see continual
passing to and fro; much cattle and many camels
and asses, and people that will look strange to thee,
but fear not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled at her reassuringly, but her eyes held a
far-away look of inexpressible sadness, at sight of
which he became silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the sixth night of the encampment, Isaac was
decidedly out of sorts. Several things had gone
wrong and the party was much overdue. There
had first been trouble among the pack-animals. This
adjusted, it had been found that one of the soldiers,
whose wounds had been thought of little consequence,
had grown rapidly worse, and, lastly, their
boy-captive had escaped. The veiled woman was
gone likewise, but that mattered little.</p>

<p>In a retired spot, somewhat removed from the
noises of the camp, they had spread a goat&#8217;s-hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
tent and built a fire at a little distance so that its light
would not play unpleasantly upon the features so
soon to be relaxed in death. Isaac, who had taken
the care of the sick man upon himself, watched alone
save for Miriam, who lay asleep in one corner of
the tent. For six days now he had been solicitous
for her comfort, not from any personal interest but
as a matter of war economics. It would be awkward
if fright or cold or hardship should result in
her illness and they so far from Damascus. On her
part, the little maid was losing her fear of this
young man, who treated her with no unkindness or
lack of gentle consideration.</p>

<p>Lost in thought, he sat gazing moodily into the
fire. Odd about the woman! Doubtless she had
now joined herself to some one of the caravans they
were constantly passing. Lemuel had described her
as a camp hanger-on, and her veil was evidence of
her loose moral character, since neither matron nor
maid of good repute at that period went veiled save
at marriage or while journeying, yet for six days
she had shown every sign of shrinking timidity, and
he had seen to it that she was treated with respect.
He had asked Nathan if he knew her, but the boy
had replied sullenly in the negative without turning
his head. He had asked the little maid, but her eyes
had been full of tears. For several reasons it had
not seemed best to allow speech between the captives,
and so the mystery had remained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>He had not himself questioned her, being irritated
that she rode the horse he had brought for the
maiden whose face had been in his memory ever since
that day he saw her feeding pigeons in the gorge.
He had meant to show special leniency to her family
and thus secure their consent to a marriage, scorning
to take her an unwilling captive; to force her into
an alliance she would abhor, a sin of which certain
other captains he could name had been guilty. However,
the maid could not be found and he bothered
his brain with a thousand conjectures.</p>

<p>That very day a puzzling circumstance had occurred.
While searching for the fugitive lad, Isaac
had caught the flutter of a garment and followed it
straight to its hiding place. He had not found the
boy, but this woman had knelt before him, clasping
her hands&mdash;wondrously pretty hands, he had noticed&mdash;and
in a voice remarkably soft and sweet had
besought him to leave her. He had hesitated, and
then Chivalry had gone out to succor Distress.
Planting himself in front of her retreat until the
last of his men had passed, he had followed them
without one backward glance.</p>

<p>Thinking about it now, a doubt of Lemuel&#8217;s tale
came to his mind for the first time. The veil might
be explained away, but not that refinement of voice,
not&mdash;a movement by the fire attracted his attention.
He stared incredulously, for there, hovering over
the blaze, was the girl of his dreams. It could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
no other than the face he had carried in his memory
all these months. Stranger even than the apparition,
she had been the veiled woman, for the garment&#8217;s
tatters were even now drawn tightly about her shivering
form. Behind the girl somebody appeared
and clutched her by the arm. It was a boy&mdash;<i>the</i> boy&mdash;but
Isaac did not move. Nathan&#8217;s alarm exhibited
itself in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I awoke and missed thee. Rachel, knowest thou
not that whosoever hath kindled this fire is not far
off?&#8221; He scanned the darkness anxiously, but the
outlines of the tent were not visible where it lay,
outside the pale of the firelight. &#8220;Come, Rachel.
Hast thou no fear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tones were the same low, musical ones he had
heard that day: &#8220;I was so cold, Nathan, so cold. I
watched a long time and saw no one, the soldiers
from whom we escaped being some distance away
as thou knowest, and I became persuaded that if
any but an angel had built this fire it could be none
other than a friend. Even now I feel it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the boy&#8217;s entreaties were not to be
denied and after a time she allowed herself to be
led away to their place of concealment. Isaac noted
its direction. He was sick at heart. To think he
had had the opportunity he craved and had not
known it. He could have saved her these hardships
and had not done so. And then a savage joy possessed
him. She was his beyond all power of interference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
He knew her hiding place, but he would
be careful not to frighten her by any vehemence of
word or action. He would treat her gently, as was
due the maiden who would be acceptable in the great
house he called &#8220;home.&#8221; He would first provide
for her comfort and teach her to trust him, then,
when he offered her honorable marriage, she would
accept gladly, gratefully. It was all so simple. Perhaps
it had been best, after all, that things had
turned out this way instead of&mdash;</p>

<p>A little hand was suddenly slipped into his and a
little voice cried excitedly: &#8220;I saw them by the fire:
Rachel, the maid to whom my brother Benjamin is
betrothed, and Nathan. Was it not nice she had
her wedding veil to cover herself before all these
strange, rough men? But Benjamin keepeth my
father&#8217;s flock out on the hills of Israel and knoweth
not how it fareth with Rachel. Wilt thou send him
word?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier was stunned. He gazed at Miriam
stupidly for a moment, for several moments. At
last he seized her face between his hands and held
it where the firelight shone full upon it. &#8220;Thy name,
little maid,&#8221; he commanded, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miriam, daughter of Caleb.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell back a pace, repeating the words as if to
recall memories: &#8220;Miriam, daughter of Caleb ...
thy brother keeping his father&#8217;s flock on the hills of
Israel.... Benjamin, sayest thou?... Thy village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Hannathon, whose outgoing is the Valley of
Jiptha-el.... <i>Benjamin!</i> Ah, strangely familiar
hath thy appearance been to me. I wondered whom
thou didst remind me of. And now that I recall it,
not only have I heard thy name but I have seen thee.
Thou wert the little maid with Rachel in the gorge,
and there was a lad older than Nathan. &#8216;Eli,&#8217; his
brother, sayest thou? And I have taken captive
Benjamin&#8217;s sister! Would that I had known it six
days ago!&#8221;</p>

<p>He resumed his old position near the door of the
tent, his head buried in his hands. &#8220;And this maiden,
Rachel&mdash;Benjamin&#8217;s betrothed? Nay, it cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miriam said it was; said it with so much detail
he could not doubt; said it with a calm matter-of-factness
that was torture unspeakable to the listener,
who was ill with disappointment; rebellious
at the thought of failure in that which he had resolved;
stubbornly determined to admit no defeat
as long as there was one ray of hope. At last, finding
him quite unresponsive, Miriam crept away to
her leopard&#8217;s skin bed and sobbed herself to sleep,
not knowing that he was so young and inexperienced
and pain so new and strange that he knew not how
to meet it.</p>

<p>That night he fought the hardest battle of his
life, a battle not with flesh and blood, which were
easier to overcome, but with his own undisciplined
spirit, and in the gray of the morning, as he watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a life embark on the Great Unknown, the better
part of him won. When Miriam awoke he greeted
her with the friendly smile she had come to expect.
They would be on the march very soon, he said, but
before they started perhaps they had better talk over
something he had in mind, and then they fell to planning
together for the relief of the wayfarers, Rachel
and Nathan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


DAMASCUS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ninth day, shortly after noon, Isaac&#8217;s company
neared Damascus. They traveled slowly, carrying
the dead body of their comrade, but not too
slowly for Miriam, to whom grief for the past and
uncertainty as to the future loomed larger than the
delights of new experiences. They paused a moment
on the heights above and looked down upon the
city.</p>

<p>Isaac pointed with pride: &#8220;Seest thou, little maid,
that the buildings, crowded so closely together and
all covered with gray plaster, make Damascus look
like a pearl. It is a pearl set in emeralds, for it
lieth in the midst of fragrant gardens and shady
orchards which entirely surround it, and in which
thou mayest travel for hours on hours before reaching
the desert. All this is wrought by our two good
friends, the River Abana and the River Pharpar,
which hath made Damascus possible. Without
them this would be but desert sands. The Pharpar
flows through the plains to the south of us, but the
Abana, like a faithful servant to her mistress, the
Queen of Cities, washes off the dust of her feet.
Every street and every dwelling hath its marble fountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
supplied by the Abana&#8217;s cold and sparkling
waters. Freely doth it flow for rich and poor alike.
Thou shalt see its wonders and its beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He touched his horse and they moved on, leaving
the exhilarating air of the hills, traversing roads
which lay between fascinating vistas of garden and
orchard, such as he had described, and finally entering
the great, crowded gate. To Miriam the city
presented more perils than the wilderness. The bustle
of the streets appeared like confusion; the gayly
colored garments everywhere looked odd, even fantastic,
while the cries of the merchandise vendors
and the constant din of conversation in many voices
and many languages were bewildering. She drew
closer to the young captain, imploring, fearful.</p>

<p>He smiled reassuringly. &#8220;We stop here, nay, not
to dismount but only to leave the men. This is the
&#8216;barracks&#8217; where I live when I am not at home, but
thou and I go further.&#8221;</p>

<p>She grew faint with apprehension. Was she now
to be sold as a slave? But what else could one expect
in this terrible heathen city?</p>

<p>They were taking the &#8220;farther ride&#8221; of which he
had spoken. &#8220;Seest thou this splendid temple, little
maid? Notice its magnificence and its vast size.
It is the House of Rimmon, the sun-god of the
Syrians. Nay, not my god. If I believe at all, and
sometimes I wonder how it is possible to know which
god is the true one among so many, it is Jehovah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
whom I was taught to worship even as thou, my
mother being a captive from the Land of Israel
like thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had not meant to bring that pained expression
to Miriam&#8217;s face. All at once he noticed how small
she was and how forlorn. His voice became soothing.
&#8220;I am taking thee to the house where she went,
where she grew up and married my father, who was
chief steward there and an Egyptian. I was born in
that house and call it &#8216;home&#8217; even yet, for I am much
with my master. It is the House of Naaman, commander-in-chief
of the armies of Syria. I think
thou wilt wait upon his wife, Adah. My sister,
Milcah, hath a position of authority among the female
servants, and if she seemeth to thee at first
somewhat severe, thou must remember that she hath
much care, so much that her heart hath great ado
to show itself. But peradventure&#8221; (questioningly)
&#8220;thou wouldst enjoy a Quest for the Hidden Heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her answer was prevented by their arrival at the
largest abode Miriam had ever seen, and the next
hour was a very trying one. She did not meet the
mistress she was to serve. Instead, she was taken
straight to Milcah, the soldier&#8217;s sister, the Lady of
the Hidden Heart, whose welcome was critical rather
than cordial. After a little while Isaac bade her
good-by for the present, holding her hand tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou wilt be happy here, and I will come often
to see how thou doest. Thou must feel free to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
me everything, just as thou wouldst talk with thy
brother, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she would not let him depart. She was in an
agony of terror, clinging to him and begging him
piteously not to leave her.</p>

<p>He was perplexed and distressed. Stooping, he
caressed her; took her in his arms and attempted to
soothe her in quite a big-brother fashion; told her
about his debt to Benjamin, which he should repay
to her; reassured her about the kindness of those
among whom he had brought her; promised to come
every day; tried to divert her attention to the fountain
in the peaceful courtyard and the other beauties
around them; sought to arouse her courage and inspire
hope. After a time she became calm and suffered
him to leave, but before going he had a few
sharp words with his sister, Milcah, who had looked
on coldly, impatiently, at these proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if I had naught to do but act as child&#8217;s nurse!
Assuredly she will be well treated. Hath anything
else ever been known in the House of Naaman?&#8221;</p>

<p>With this ungracious promise he had to be content,
but never before had he taken his way to the
barracks with such a heavy heart. He paused two
or three times and looked back, as if debating
whether or not to return, but finally went on. Meanwhile,
with expedition and no waste of sympathy,
Miriam was bathed, under Milcah&#8217;s direction, and
dressed in garments hastily adapted for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
out of those intended for a much larger maid. The
rest of the afternoon time dragged. Miriam, very
forlorn indeed, was yet very brave, as she had promised
Isaac to be. She expected to be put to work immediately,
to be given tasks that would try her
strength and patience to the utmost, but, apparently,
there was nothing for her to do.</p>

<p>Venturing into the courtyard, she observed that
if the dwelling looked large on the outside, it was
immense within and sheltered a household so numerous
that the arrival of one more made no difference
whatever. Somewhat later she had her supper, a
bounteous meal that she could not swallow for the
lump in her throat, and then Milcah sent her to bed
in a large room with several of the maid servants.
It was a softer bed than any she had ever known, but
not one of ease. She lay there thinking, thinking
until the intolerable pain in her throat was at last
relieved by tears, but she was careful to smother the
sobs lest she disturb those whose regular breathing
told her they were asleep. She could reach out her
hand and touch them, they were so near, yet she was
alone, quite, quite alone! No one cared about her
except, strangely enough, the soldier who had
brought her hither! If she could only cuddle down
in her mother&#8217;s arms, or her father&#8217;s! Oh, the sobs
would not be stifled! What if the Lady of the Hidden
Heart should hear?</p>

<p>As if in answer to this despairing cry, Milcah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
stood, looking down upon her. &#8220;Exactly what I
feared,&#8221; she commented, &#8220;and to-morrow no work
will be done because the sound of thy weeping to-night
will go forth to disturb the household. Thus
is mischief wrought by a brother&#8217;s thoughtlessness.
Do thou come into the room with me, and if thou
must weep, none will be distressed, for much care
maketh me always wakeful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not unkindly though entirely without tenderness,
Miriam was assisted to make the change, but the
fountain of tears seemed frozen. For the rest of
the night she lay with wide-open eyes, staring but
unseeing, sick to the very soul. Yet did she not
suffer alone. From his comparatively hard couch
over in the barracks, Isaac all at once sprang up,
alert, listening. Noiselessly he crossed the room,
opened a door, and stepped out into the starlight.
Still were the voices of traffic and people which had
so terrified Miriam that day. The city slumbered.
He looked across roof after roof to two which
towered above the others, ghostlike in the whiteness
of their plastered exteriors. One was the palace,
the other the House of Naaman.</p>

<p>A long, long while he stood there, then he returned
to his bed, laughing softly. &#8220;I grow fanciful,&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;I dreamed I heard the sobbing of
the little maid. As if I could at this distance, or as
if she were weeping when she hath doubtless been
asleep these many hours!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Yet for some reason the soldier slept but fitfully
the remainder of the night. Into his passive brain
swarmed long-forgotten tales he had heard at his
mother&#8217;s knee: tales of her captivity; of her loneliness
and home-sickness; but because he had known
her only in days of contentment and prosperity, they
had seemed to him but as tales. Now he understood.
With features drawn as if in pain he groaned:
&#8220;If only, ah, if only!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the morning he went home very early, only to
find that the little maid was too weak and ill to rise.</p>

<p>His sister spoke her mind without reserve. &#8220;I am
not pleased, Isaac, that thou shouldst have brought
this child hither. She will be much trouble and little
help. We can do nothing now except endure it,
but I hope thou wilt never take captive another
maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>He promised fervently, and Milcah surveyed his
retreating form with great satisfaction. &#8220;When I
talk to Isaac,&#8221; she told herself, &#8220;always can I cause
him to see the right, and no other woman hath such
influence with him&mdash;so far.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was truly a wonderful house to which Miriam
had come. In the first place it had no front door.
The outside was just a blank wall of gray plaster
with a few small openings, very high up, and instead
of a door there was a gate: a large, highly ornamented,
metal gate at which a keeper always stood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
From this you will understand that none of the
rooms looked out upon the street save through those
little, latticed openings above everybody&#8217;s heads, the
real doors and windows being on the other side (the
inside), where they opened upon a wide veranda
and then upon a square courtyard. You could stand
in one doorway, for example, and see rows and
rows of rooms facing the four sides of this courtyard
but not opening into each other.</p>

<p>You might think you would miss seeing the street,
but how could you when the courtyard had its fountain
and grass and flowers and trees and even birds?
All of the courtyards were pretty and peaceful, even
that where the animals were kept, the word &#8220;all&#8221;
being used advisedly, for while most houses had one
court or two or three at most, this one had seven.
You would get lost trying to find your way about.
The rooms were large and high, and so clean and
well furnished! On three sides were low and wide
benches, where you sat in the daytime and slept
at night on the soft cushions and thick mattresses
which were never put away. There was nothing else
in these apartments, but, of course, there was
nothing else to want except the queer little pans
containing lighted wood or charcoal which would
be brought in when it was cold.</p>

<p>The portion of the building set aside for the use
of the master and mistress and their guests had not
more but only more elegant furniture. Here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
courtyard was paved with marble and inside the
apartments the low and wide benches were made of
carved cedar inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl
and tortoise-shell in intricate designs. Here the
cushions were covered with beautifully colored silks,
the mattresses with heavier material, and there were
curtains of silk and linen and rugs spread down to
walk upon. Miriam, surveying this magnificence
surreptitiously, decided that while it was quite right
and proper in such a place and for such a purpose,
it was entirely unnecessary for the rest of the household.
With the rooms and verandas all floored and
kept so clean, who would need carpets? And there
were almost no ants or mice! As for cushions, silk
would not wear nearly so long, she was sure, as the
sheepskin and goatskin stuffed with wool which
were so plentiful in the other apartments. The master,
Naaman, must be very rich to maintain such a
splendid dwelling. It was awe-inspiring just to contemplate
its glories.</p>

<p>Out of doors it was even more interesting. You
could go up a stone staircase in the corner of one of
the courts and come out on the roof. You need not
be afraid. There was no danger. It was only one
story high&mdash;although that was very high indeed&mdash;and
the roof was flat. Besides, the wall built around
the edge would keep you from falling. You could
see so much and so far! You could look down into
the narrow and crowded streets of Damascus itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
where brilliantly garbed throngs were constantly
coming and going on interminable errands, and beyond
that to miles of verdure and swamp land and
several swift, silvery streams, offshoots of the Pharpar
and the Abana, and beyond that still to the long,
low-lying bluish-purple hills and the dun-colored
desert. It would be just according to your mood
whether or not your gaze returned to Damascus and
fastened itself upon the one other building more
pretentious than this: the palace where dwelt King
Ben-hadad and his court, and then wandered off to
the three great gates of Damascus, through which
many entered and some never returned.</p>

<p>There were numerous people in the household of
Naaman, almost as many, she was sure, as lived in
a whole &#8220;city&#8221; in Israel, so it was not strange they
should have different languages. How very dissimilar
each individual was from the other! Odd
that we should all have eyes and ears and noses and
mouths and hair and yet no two look alike! The
only person of the entire household whose ways and
speech were the least familiar was Milcah, sister to
the young soldier who had brought her hither, and
Milcah was much, much older than her brother and
much, much harder to please.</p>

<p>Isaac&#8217;s daily visits and trifling gifts of fruit or
flowers, at first received listlessly, gradually acquired
greater value in Miriam&#8217;s eyes until they were the
only bright spots on an otherwise monotonous horizon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
The marvels of her new home had no charms
for her at first. They dawned upon her gradually as,
day after day, with wan face and lagging footsteps,
and in response to Isaac&#8217;s encouragement, she
roamed through the big house, smiling wistfully
upon those who were often too busy to smile in response.
She was not resentful. The hurt came in
the fact that they were absorbed in their own affairs,
in which she had no part. And in Hannathon she
had been so necessary!</p>

WAYFARERS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> western or southwestern gate of Damascus,
that which looked toward Israel and Egypt, had seen
much coming and going of late. Varied features
and varied dispositions, people large and small, old
and young, bond and free, soldiers and civilians,
on all manner of business and pleasure they had
passed, but never a couple more likely to attract attention
than the maiden and the boy who now approached.
There was something inexpressibly gentle
and refined in her appearance which contrasted
oddly with her tattered garments and the leopard&#8217;s
skin drawn closely around her. The boy seemed
more fitted for the wilderness and the hardships
they had evidently endured.</p>

<p>They were talking low and eagerly. &#8220;Thinkest
thou, Rachel,&#8221; with a touch of scorn, &#8220;that the Lord
would send an angel in these times and to us as he
did to our fathers?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sweetly reasonable. &#8220;Then how dost
thou explain the fire with no one near it the night
when I thought I should die with the cold; and this
leopard&#8217;s skin we found next morning near the embers;
and the food&mdash;so much we have had enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and to spare; and the water-skin filled with life-giving
water for which we thirsted; and even these
strips of cloth to bind up our bleeding feet, cut on
the sharp rocks, bruised on the rough road? Nay,
no matter what thou sayest, Nathan, I have learned
that Jehovah is merciful and gracious, full of loving-kindness
and tender mercies with which we have
been surrounded. Indeed, now that our perils are
nearly over, I feel that all I have gone through hath
been but a spiritual experience. The Lord hath
been my strength, just as Miriam told me, and he
is about to become my song. Soon we shall reach
the home of my kinsman, Ezekiel, where we shall
not only be safe and well cared for ourselves, but
he will know what to do concerning Miriam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Rachel!&#8221; Nathan was glaring after
a man with a heavy load who had stumbled against
them. &#8220;A good thing it is that the road is straight
and smooth. Keep thou close to me and watch thy
steps.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had need to. As they proceeded the travel
increased. They were jostled; they jumped quickly
out of the way of those who rode, only to be pushed
in another direction by those who walked; they met
frowns and ill-natured remarks and, what was
harder to bear, smiles and unmistakable jests. They
had about concluded that Might rather than Right
was the rule of the highway when their opinion was
confirmed. As they came within the shadow of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
city gates, but before they could enter, they were
espied by a gay party, looking for sport.</p>

<p>By the very simple device of joining hands, a circle
was formed around the two unfortunates and
they were thus entirely at the will of their tormentors.
Nathan&#8217;s rage and Rachel&#8217;s entreaties
merely added to the amusement. The circle advanced
and retreated, dragging its victims along with
it. They were mimicked with exaggerated pantomime.
They were forced into ridiculous and undignified
postures. One, bolder or more facetious
than the rest, indulged in hair-pulling and pinching.</p>

<p>The roars of laughter attracted the attention of
passers-by, who joined the gathering, some to jeer
and encourage, others to inquire and protest. The
crowd grew, the noise increased, the road was obstructed
and, trying to force a passage, many came
to angry arguments and finally to blows. The excitement
was quelled only by the arrival of soldiers,
who finally hurried to the scene and in no gentle
manner dispersed the mob. To Rachel, bruised and
humiliated, this was a welcome relief. She did not
notice the curious gaze of the soldiers, the changing
expression on the face of one, nor that another
looked at her intently for a moment, then, urging his
horse to full speed, set off in the direction of the
House of Naaman.</p>

<p>Nathan, with wits sharpened by terror, lost none
of these things nor a host of others, and hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
came to the conclusion that their deliverance was
cause only for additional fear. He clutched Rachel&#8217;s
hand: &#8220;We must go back as we came. Hearest
thou? We cannot go into the city to-day. Dost
thou not see that these are the soldiers from whom
we escaped? They will know me and guess whom
thou art, even without thy veil.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was violently pulling backward; the crowd, so
long detained and anxious to make up for lost time,
surging forward. As well try to stem the Jordan
with bare hands! They were swept apart, and before
Rachel realized it, she stood within the portals
of Damascus, dismayed and alone. With Miriam
in captivity and Nathan lost, it was more than ever
imperative that she find Ezekiel and that without
delay, but how? She stood at one side of the busy
footway, anxiously waiting to see if Nathan would
join her. When he did not and she found herself
again attracting attention, she singled out one in
the hurrying throng and appealed to him timidly:
&#8220;Canst thou direct me to the House of Ezekiel in
the street of the merchants of Israel?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked at her, shook his head, and answered
in a language she did not understand.
Others she tried, but with no better success. They
were not unkind, merely uncomprehending&mdash;and indifferent.
Peradventure if she walked along slowly,
constantly seeking, constantly asking, she might&mdash;she
must&mdash;somewhere discover one of her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
people, or at least one whose speech was the same
as her own. Already the sun was casting long
shadows and with a sinking heart Rachel proceeded
on her way, never seeing a soldier who followed her
cautiously and at a safe distance. He also watched
the sun. At last he approached near enough to hear
her question, put now not so much with timidity as
with desperation. He addressed her in her own
tongue: &#8220;I know the man thou seekest. Thou hast
but to come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although his pronunciation was distinctly bad,
she turned with pleasure at the words, but at sight
of the speaker she shrank back, shivering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thoughtest thou to escape?&#8221; He was regarding
her with a kind of cruel exultation. &#8220;I have
found thee again as I swore I would, and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand rested compellingly upon her shoulder.
The girl pleaded tremulously: &#8220;Is it not enough
that thou shouldst have taken me captive in Israel?
Yet did the God of my fathers preserve me then
and later on the road hither. I shall believe that here
in Damascus I shall fare no worse. Thy name, I
know, is Lemuel, and there must be some law, some
protection for the innocent&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite the bravery of the words her voice faltered.
She was weary and heartsick. Had she endured
so much only to fall into danger at every
step? Her captor had drawn her within an alley-way
and in the fast gathering dusk the hurrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
pedestrians neither saw nor heard aught amiss. He
spoke in a tone of easy confidence, secure in possession,
but Rachel heeded not. She was planning
escape, yet weighed down by a sense of her own
helplessness. With a grip on her arm which made
her wince with pain, she felt herself hurried along
to an unknown destination.</p>

<p>Emerging upon a less frequented thoroughfare,
they unexpectedly encountered two men on horseback,
riding slowly and straining their eyes into
the night as if in search of something or somebody.
The man at Rachel&#8217;s side glanced carelessly; again
more intently and with a muttered exclamation partially
relaxed his hold. That instant&#8217;s indecision
lost him his prey. With a strength at which she
wondered Rachel tore herself out of his grasp and
fled, whither she knew not. A few moments had
sufficed to change her into a fugitive, afraid of people,
afraid of the torches which the few travelers
still abroad were compelled to carry. She sought
only some dark corner in which to stand panting and
then, afraid lest even its kindly shelter be sinister, to
hurry to another.</p>

<p>It was in the intense darkness and stillness which
precedes the dawn that the girl, utterly exhausted,
crouched in the shadow thrown by a large dwelling
and fell into a deep sleep. When the world turned
gray two men on horseback extinguished their
torches and approached the entrance to this abode.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
The face of one was ashy with fatigue and disappointment.
Observing the huddled figure he bent
over it and uttered a joyful exclamation, beckoning
for the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our search is ended. While we roamed abroad
by night, she whom we sought found her way alone
to protection. Quickly, bring food and water and
borrow a cloak from one of the maid servants, while
I remain here to guard the maiden.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voices awakened the sleeper. Startled and
confused, Rachel found herself gazing into the face
of the very young captain who had commanded
the little company of soldiers under whose escort
she had been brought from Israel. She recalled to
mind the respect with which he had seen to it she
was treated; his courtesy the day he had discovered
her hiding place, yet fear made her suspicious. She
would have fled once more, but before she could rise
she noticed the compassion in his look, the deference
in his manner. His reassuring words were spoken
in her own tongue and as though it were native to
him.</p>

<p>The incident at the gate, he said, and Rachel recalled
her experience with a shudder, had attracted
the attention of his servant, who had brought him
word. Together they had sought her through the
streets of the city throughout the night, hoping to
aid her, to give her a better impression of Damascus
than she had evidently formed. As they had returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
almost persuaded that she must have found
friends with whom she was sheltered, they had discovered
her asleep, at the portal of the House
of Naaman, of whom she had doubtless heard and
who was as good as he was great. The servant
had now gone for some refreshment. When she
had partaken and her strength was somewhat restored,
she would permit him, he hoped, to assist her
to make plans for the future.</p>

<p>All at once the nerve-tension relaxed and Rachel
found herself strangely weak and trembling. She
answered with puzzled relief: &#8220;Thou dost not look
altogether like my people, but thou speakest as one.
Canst thou direct me to the House of Ezekiel, in the
street of the merchants of Israel? He is my kinsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anxious expression left the young man&#8217;s face.
&#8220;Yea,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as soon as thou hast eaten and
drunken&mdash;and here cometh my servant-thou wilt
find that I am the way. Behold, I go before thee.
Follow thou me.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later Rachel, guided by the soldier, arrived
at the street and the dwelling she had so greatly
desired to find, but disappointment awaited her.
&#8220;Ezekiel? Yea, he <i>was</i> here,&#8221; she was told, &#8220;but
a month ago he died and only yesterday his family
started back to Israel.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rachel was not Isaac&#8217;s only problem. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Miriam. That she was related to the shepherd who
had nursed him with tender care through a long illness
meant, to the young man, that he should see to
her welfare; that the gift he had brought his master&#8217;s
wife from the enemy&#8217;s country should be unappreciated,
that the child was unwanted and unwelcome,
stirred him to profound indignation; and
that she grieved for the home and loved ones from
which he had ruthlessly taken her roused his deepest
pity.</p>

<p>In compensation he gave her the best of himself&mdash;his
leisure moments, his most unselfish thought.
All at once he became critical of his own motives and
those of others. Miriam had such an uncomfortable
way of looking him straight in the eye and innocently
inquiring, &#8220;Thinkest thou Jehovah would be
pleased?&#8221; He had never thought before nor cared.
&#8220;Jehovah&#8221; was a name his mother reverenced and
to which his sister was not indifferent, but it had
meant nothing in particular to him. Now, however,
with the obligation of answering the frank questions
of this small maiden, who seemed to believe
him the embodiment of wisdom, he began to observe
and compare conduct, to ask himself what was worth
while and why. As the weeks and months went by,
such considerations could not fail to react upon his
own ideals nor remain unnoticed by others.</p>

<p>In his wife&#8217;s apartments lingered Naaman,
soldier-statesman of Syria. &#8220;What thinkest thou,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Adah, of the little maid who is of the Land of Israel?&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife toyed with a silken tassel. &#8220;I know not
indeed, having seen her but a time or two and that
from a distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then thou dost not care for the present Isaac
brought thee, with such elation, from afar?&#8221; Something
there was in the cool displeasure of the tone
which caused the lady suddenly to remember that
Isaac&#8217;s parents had served her husband&#8217;s family;
that Isaac&#8217;s mother had been Naaman&#8217;s nurse; and
that Isaac himself had been born in that very
house.</p>

<p>She hastened to her own defense. &#8220;The maid of
whom thou speakest hath been so woe-begone I felt
I owed it to myself not to be troubled by her sadness.
Milcah hath borne tidings of her and I was
not attracted.&#8221;</p>

<p>His reply was dictated by long observation and
much worldly knowledge. &#8220;Milcah taketh precautions
lest she be supplanted later. Fear hath eyes
of its own and its vision is oft distorted. Thou wilt
be wise, I think, to judge of the little maid for thyself.
It hath been my experience that where there
is a drop of Israelitish blood, there is trustworthiness.
Oft have I wondered if their religion had
aught to do with it. Look thou at Isaac. Because
he understandeth the tongue of Israel, I sent him
with Lemuel, kinsman of thy friend, to spy out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
land to the south of us. Of the two, Isaac brought
back the more detailed and reliable information.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah was glad to turn the conversation into this
new channel. &#8220;Was it for this thou didst reward
him with the captaincy of a small band? My friends
were somewhat displeased, hoping no doubt for such
preferment for Lemuel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man frowned. &#8220;Should I not reward justly?
Isaac is young, thou sayest? Ah, but age is not a
matter of birthdays. He joyeth in responsibility.&#8221;
The speaker smiled. &#8220;Hast thou not observed his
care over the little maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Later and alone, Adah, wife of Naaman, sat
wrapped in reflection. It were undoubtedly right
and politic to please one&#8217;s husband. His judgment
concerning the little maid should be respected. He
was impulsive but astute. Of course, when properly
trained, even a tiny maid would be useful, but oh,
the tediousness, the annoyance of the training! She
would be awkward and heedless. Nay, for the
present at least it would be best to wait.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


DOUBTS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> six months passed. In the House of
Amos, friend of that Ezekiel who had died, sat Rachel,
the scalding tears dropping from between her
fingers. She was not unmindful that Rebekah, wife
of Amos, was holding a guarded conversation out
in the courtyard with her bosom friend and that it
concerned her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think her trouble hath affected her mind,&#8221;
the neighbor was saying. &#8220;When thou wert gone
to the Street of the Bakers I peeped in at the door
and she was laughing and crying over a bracelet
made of dried grasses which was hung around her
neck. She would have hidden it when I appeared,
but when I insisted upon knowing its history she
said it had been given her by the young shepherd
to whom she is betrothed. They were children then
and played at a wedding and she kept the foolish
token. It is the nearest she will ever come to a
marriage, poor child, and I told her so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rebekah nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou knowest,&#8221; the other woman continued,
&#8220;that the soldier who brought her hither cometh
not at all since the first day or two, when he came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
inquire how she fared. Then he did not ask to
see her, nor even when he brought thee the gold
wherewith to purchase her new clothing. Didst
thou not think it strange that he wished her to think
the gift came from Amos and thee? To my mind
it is plain that he desireth to be rid of the maiden.
Peradventure he is relieved to place the responsibility
with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under this positive indictment Rebekah&#8217;s double
chin quivered. &#8220;All we know of her,&#8221; she agreed,
&#8220;is that some six months ago she came somewhat
after dawn, which hath seemed very odd to me, with
a young soldier, evidently an officer, seeking Ezekiel,
and that Amos, in pity for her distress, took her into
our home until we could find out something about
her. Yet, beyond the tale she telleth, we know no
more than at first. Gentle she is and sweet and if
what she saith be true&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rebekah&#8217;s friend regarded her severely. &#8220;The
minute I saw her with the soldier I knew that no
good would come of it. Thou didst say the same
and her story goeth but to prove&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The voices sunk lower. Rachel could catch the
import but not the words. However, she had heard
enough. They doubted her account of herself and
she had no way whereby to prove it. She might, of
course, make an attempt to find the soldier who had
been so kind. His name was &#8220;Isaac&#8221; and he had
spoken of the great House of Naaman as &#8220;home,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
but she hesitated to throw herself upon the mercy
of any man. The bitterness of being allowed a
shelter on a sufferance which might terminate at
any time! Where was she to go? What to do?
And not for herself alone was she anxious. What
had become of Nathan? How fared it with poor
little Miriam?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meanwhile Miriam, formerly of the Land
of Israel, now of the Land of Syria but always, at
least in her happier moments, a dweller in the Land
of Make-Believe, where you and I once lived, had
discovered something new. By piling the cushions
high on that wide bench which ran around three
sides of the room, and standing upon them, she could
look through the window-opening out upon the
street. The lattice, which kept out the bats so
nicely, would also prevent anyone on the outside
from seeing the face at the window.</p>

<p>There was so much to be seen close at hand!
From the roof, the figures on the streets of Damascus
looked almost as small as had the ants
crawling about their hills in Israel. Why, there was
Isaac coming and he had a timbrel under his arm!
She was sure it was for her because she had mentioned,
one day, how much better she could sing
the Lord&#8217;s songs when accompanied by music, and
they had talked about timbrels. She knew just how
he would give it to her. He would make an elaborate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
bow and say: &#8220;Fair lady, accept, I pray thee,
a fond token of remembrance from thy faithful subjects
beyond the Great Sea who have sent this,
through many and great dangers, by the hand of thy
devoted slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would take it with very grand airs, just as if
she were a fair lady with subjects beyond the Great
Sea and it had been sent through many dangers,
when they both knew that he had bought it for her
in that very city in one of those puzzling little shops
he had told her about and which he was going to
take her to see some time. She wondered if it would
be the day he would also take her to see Rachel, who
was so happy in the home of Ezekiel&#8217;s friend in the
street of the merchants of Israel.</p>

<p>Next she would become extremely grave and tell
him that just before he came into the courtyard
somebody had thrown him a kiss. She knew it for
a fact, but he would never guess who it was. At
first he would not believe such a thing, then he
would reluctantly admit that she might have seen a
kiss thrown, but it was surely meant for someone
else&mdash;Milcah, perhaps. This being denied, he would
accept her word for it, but be very much mystified
and make so many wild and improbable guesses as
to the source from which it came that it was a great
deal of fun. At last he would give it up and she
would have to tell him that it was herself. At this
he would assume a comical expression of relief and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
say that such being the case he was not so distressed
because, not having any little sister of his own, he
had adopted her, but if it had been anyone else&mdash;here
his tone would become tragic&mdash;he would be
most uncomfortable, for, as she knew, he was so
bashful. At this they would both laugh, for he was
not bashful at all, and their play would be over.</p>

<p>They would then sit on the marble bench under
the damson tree in the courtyard, where they could
see the fountain and hear the birds, and he would
give her a lesson. Every day he taught her a few
words of Syrian and encouraged her to tell him all
her experiences since the day before in that language
so that she would the sooner become proficient.
Thus she began to &#8220;save up&#8221; things to relate
and to &#8220;pick up&#8221; words as she wandered among
the maid servants. He had begun this task as a
dreaded duty. He continued it as a pleasure, finding
her intelligent and quick and her ideas frequently
original.</p>

<p>Miriam neither guessed his one-time aversion to
these lessons nor his present satisfaction. He was
learning tact as well as patience. She only knew
that he was sufficiently young to grasp her viewpoint
just as Eli had once done&mdash;that Eli about whom she
was so voluble. &#8220;Because Benjamin had Rachel to
talk to,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;and I am going to marry
Eli when I grow up.&#8221; He wondered why he felt
complimented that she should tell him this &#8220;secret,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
but he did. In response he gravely approved her
choice, and even asked the privilege of being the
friend of the bridegroom, who would, according to
Eastern usage, make the necessary arrangements!
The lesson over he would say good-by until the
next day, and when he had gone she always found
that the sun did not seem to shine so brightly.</p>

<p>She was still gazing through the lattice when she
was suddenly jerked down, and a voice she had
learned to fear said, indignantly, &#8220;I know the man
to whom thou art throwing kisses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam fingered her arm ruefully. To get those
bruises over that! She answered a little triumphantly:
&#8220;Nay, Milcah, it was no man at all. It was
only Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sound from the veranda wonderfully
like a stifled laugh, but it passed unnoticed in the
excitement. Milcah&#8217;s tones were coldly severe: &#8220;In
justice I shall have to say that I can find no fault
with thy general conduct, but I have observed that
thou art very bold toward my brother. Shame on
thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was stunned. Bold! Why, to be that was
to be the worst thing on earth, for a bold maiden
was never respected. Her mother had told her.
After a long minute she found voice: &#8220;Thinkest
thou I do not know that &#8216;men&#8217; are strangers or those
who have no right to caress thee? Thinkest thou
my mother hath not warned me to be careful? Isaac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
is not a man. He is just&mdash;just&mdash;Isaac. The same
as Benjamin. I almost hated him at first because
he took me from my home&#8221;&mdash;the words came chokingly&mdash;&#8220;but
he hath explained to me that he cannot
take me back, yet he repenteth of the evil he hath
done and seeketh to make me happy. <i>Thou</i> hast
never been kind&mdash;nor anyone else in this big house
save Isaac&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She could say no more, but with heart almost
bursting under its load of grief and misunderstanding,
she ran swiftly past Isaac without seeing him
and hid somewhere to weep for the mother she never
expected to see again. Milcah was limp with despair
when her brother entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;At her age <i>I</i> never attracted a man&#8217;s attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor at any age, sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman glanced at him quickly and beheld
what she had never thought to see in his face&mdash;a
wrath so great that she cowered before it. His
tones were new and strange: &#8220;Oft hast thou told
me, sister, of our great leader, Moses, who met Jehovah
face to face in the flaming bush of the desert.
I go to the desert but to fight its wandering hordes of
warriors. Hast thou considered where <i>I</i> am to meet
Jehovah? Might it not be in the pure heart of this
little maid? Certainly I have done nothing to deserve
her gratitude and affection, and thou as little;
but if I were worthy, I think there is naught that
could hold a man to higher thoughts and better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
deeds than the trust and expectancy in the eyes of
a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker departed hurriedly. He too could
say no more, for quite suddenly his own shortcomings
swarmed before him like black specters with
murderous intent. Why had he not told Miriam of
her brother&#8217;s captivity? Why had he not taken her
to see Rachel? Why had he failed to tell the older
maiden of the presence in Syria of her betrothed?
Why had he not sought out Benjamin, as he had
long ago promised? Was it enough that he had assured
himself of his benefactor&#8217;s safety? Nay, he
lacked courage. That was it: he was afraid, he, a
soldier! He was afraid to lose the flattering confidence
of the little maid; afraid to expose himself
to the fascination Rachel still held for him; afraid
to confess the injury he had unwittingly wrought
Benjamin, the man to whom he was indebted. The
thought was bitter: he&mdash;afraid. Yet it was true.
He would begin reparation by telling Miriam of
Benjamin; by taking her this very day to see Rachel;
but she was nowhere to be found and he went away
regretful. On the morrow, if he could obtain permission,
he would be far away. <i>If</i> he could obtain
permission! Did he not come and go at another&#8217;s
will? The morrow might bring duties elsewhere.</p>

<p>Milcah, when Isaac had gone, sat down weakly
upon the bench which had been the scene of Miriam&#8217;s
transgression. She was face to face with a stupendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
thought. Her young brother was growing
into manhood. He formed his own opinions and
defended them. She had lost her baby! She said
the words over slowly, trying to comprehend; trying
to tear loose her heart-strings; trying to imagine
him as he would be in the future. She was dazed,
bewildered, sorrowful. That he should have rebelled
against words spoken for his own good; should have
defied her, to whom he was so dear! The outburst
had been so unnecessary, and then her anger flamed
against Miriam. Had it not been for <i>her</i> it would
never have happened. Always was there a maid,
large or small, to come between a man and his
family. Had she not seen it? It was the way of
the world. The only thing that saved the present
situation was that this was a little maid. How careful
she would have to be never to offend one whom
he loved!</p>

<p>Meditating irritably, she was annoyed to find a
small figure in her lap, a wet cheek pressed to hers:
&#8220;I am sorry, Milcah, that I said thou wert not kind.
I should have remembered thou wert not brought
up in Israel, and so thou dost not know about &#8216;showing
forth his loving-kindness in the morning and his
faithfulness every night,&#8217; but be of good comfort,
I will show thee how.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman gasped. &#8220;I need not,&#8221; she commenced
indignantly, and broke off the sentence in
the middle, glaring in displeasure but utter helplessness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
into the tear-stained face of this unwelcome
child who was taking such unwarranted liberties.
No one else would dare! Yet it was distinctly pleasant
to feel those clinging little arms. It roused one
to such unexpectedly human emotions. She wondered
how it would have been if her mother had
not frowned upon Somebody. If the brief romance,
so quickly stifled, had come true, if she had
married, would a little maid of her very own be
making charming overtures of affection like this
one?</p>

<p>All at once Milcah gathered the child to her
bosom, a little awed at the overpowering sweetness
of it but wholly lost in its joy. Without premeditation
she was whispering soft words which had never
been used since Isaac had needed them; words which
came falteringly from a tongue to which they were
new and strange; words she had thought never to
speak again. A long time they sat thus while a
maid servant peeped in at the door and, amazed at
what she saw, went away stealthily to tell the tale
to those who scoffed at it as impossible.</p>

<p>Thus did Miriam end her Quest of the Hidden
Heart, the same having been found.</p>

INTRODUCTIONS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a week later that Milcah&#8217;s voice interrupted
Miriam&#8217;s slumbers: &#8220;Arise quickly and prepare thyself.
This day thou goest with me to the shop of
Amos, the perfumer.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pair of bright eyes flew open, a cheerful voice
answered, and an agile little body was soon robing
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not that garment, Miriam, but this which
I have had woven for thee, and sandals for street-wear
and this padded cloak. The morning is cool.&#8221;</p>

<p>The recipient of these unusual attentions gazed
with delight, touching the gifts with admiration and
wonder. &#8220;&#8217;Tis so white, Milcah, the robe, I mean,
and it hath such a beautiful border of colored
threads. I like it better than fringe and I never had
so fine a cloak before nor such expensive sandals.
They are like a pair sent to Rachel from this very
city by her kinsman, Ezekiel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been a very different week from any
Miriam had passed before. Milcah&#8217;s awkward motherliness
had been all the more welcome since Isaac
had been away on business for his master. She had
seen him for but a brief and serious moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I return,&#8221; he had told her, &#8220;I must tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
thee something thou shouldst have known before.
Also, thou shalt see Rachel, but to-day there is not
time enough,&#8221; and he was gone.</p>

<p>The speech had led to much speculation as to what
that &#8220;something&#8221; might be, but then she was puzzled
by quite a number of things in the new life.
For instance, it was not a joyous household. No
one was ever merry, and if any inadvertently
laughed aloud, he or she immediately assumed an
apologetic attitude which seemed strange when
coupled with the evident prosperity of the House
of Naaman. Also, though of lesser importance,
there was one door in the Women&#8217;s Courtyard which
never remained open and through which none passed
save Milcah and, less often, Isaac. Miriam had
never asked questions. To her, the Closed Door
was an accepted but mystifying fact just as was the
Joyless Household; just as had been the Lady of the
Hidden Heart by whose side she was now crossing
the courtyard.</p>

<p>At a point just outside the gate they met
Isaac, who greeted them hurriedly. He had returned
but an hour ago, he said, and was even now
setting off on another errand on which he would be
gone a few days. This being not unusual and Milcah
likewise disposed to hasten, they went their
separate ways, but Miriam was distinctly disappointed.
He had not noticed the new garments of
which she was so happily conscious; he had not inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
where she went on this, the first occasion she
had left the House of Naaman since she had entered
it; he had scarcely seemed to see her at all.</p>

<p>Wondering much, she walked very soberly by Milcah&#8217;s
side, but the marvelous experiences of the next
two hours crowded unpleasant remembrances from
her mind. For the first time she viewed close at
hand the streets and bazaars of Damascus; those
crowded streets at which she had once been affrighted;
which she had so often observed from the
roof; which seemed mysteriously shorn of terror
now; those small, stall-like bazaars Isaac had described,
crowded with every conceivable merchandise,
salable articles hung on the walls and piled on
the ground, the merchants sitting cross-legged in
the center of their wares. It was all so bewilderingly
different from Hannathon, the only &#8220;city&#8221; she
had ever seen save Damascus!</p>

<p>The stern lines of Milcah&#8217;s mouth relaxed into a
little smile as she answered eager, excited questions
and looked into the flushed face of her companion.
&#8220;The child taketh dress,&#8221; she thought to herself.
&#8220;She is not so unattractive as at first and she commenteth
with intelligence upon what she sees. Peradventure
she may become useful to me. Her nimble
feet may oft save mine own from weariness. At
once will I begin&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Milcah&#8217;s thoughts received an unexpected
check. She stopped short, amazed and displeased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
for there, on the footway of the busy street, in front
of the shop of Amos the perfumer, stood Isaac,
talking low and earnestly with a maiden whose full
face was not visible from where they stood. The
two saw only each other, paying no attention whatever
to the jostling throngs which surged past them.</p>

<p>Milcah drew Miriam a little aside: &#8220;So this was
the meaning of his haste! Deaf is he and blind to
his only sister, and when he is married he will have
time for neither thee nor me.&#8221; She was greatly
agitated, and her impressive tones carried an unaccountable
chill to the heart of her listener. She had
lost her friend! That was why he had not seemed
to see her that morning. It would always be that
way. Miriam brushed away a tear as the two parted
with lingering adieux.</p>

<p>For the first time they saw the face of the girl at
whom he was still smiling, and Milcah was not relieved
to note that she was of undoubted beauty.
Evidently, too, she was of Israelitish blood, which
made the situation all the more hopeless. It would
be easier to urge objections against one of another
race. With determination she turned to Miriam.</p>

<p>&#8220;The maiden went into the House of Amos. With
him have I business regarding perfumes for my
mistress and with his wife have I some acquaintance,
so that I may, with no impropriety, inquire
the meaning of what we have witnessed. I would
know how long this hath continued and something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
of the maid herself. Before I am obliged to accept
her as a sister I desire to learn&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Milcah was speaking to empty air. Miriam
had already disappeared within the doorway and
when the woman arrived and had exchanged with
the inmates of the dwelling the elaborate courtesies
of the East, she found the child and the strange
maiden wholly engrossed in a happy conversation.
The older girl at last became aware of voices near
and questioning, annoyed glances. She looked up
with a face transfigured with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two beautiful surprises hath come to me to-day:
this little maid and before that Isaac came&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel paused, perceiving the sudden coolness
with which her words were received, but lifting her
head a trifle defiantly she concluded the sentence
almost with triumph: &#8220;And within the month I am
to be publicly betrothed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; commented Milcah, &#8220;that thou art
counting the days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked her steadily in the eye: &#8220;I never
wanted anything in my life so much as I want a
home in which I may hide from the cruelties I have
suffered since I was taken captive.&#8221; She brushed
away a tear. &#8220;Yet I would not be ungrateful for all
the mercies vouchsafed unto me by the God of my
fathers, nor would I be so unjust to my betrothed as
to marry him if I did not love him much, much more
than my own ease or comfort.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>A blush overspread her cheek and she smiled
down at Miriam, whom she was holding in a close
embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then thou art very sure thou lovest him and
wilt make him a worthy wife; that thou art not
taking advantage of his goodness of heart nor considering
thyself first of all.&#8221; Milcah&#8217;s tone was judicial,
almost accusing.</p>

<p>Rachel answered slowly, wonderingly: &#8220;I know
not why thou shouldst ask, but since our vows are
soon to be said before the world there is no reason
why I should not tell thee how I love him, have always
loved him&mdash;as he loveth me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milcah&#8217;s heart sank. Here was confirmation of
her worst fears. She loved him too. She did not
wish him to marry this maiden, nor any other, but if
his heart were set in this direction, she would not
want him disappointed. She would try to approve
his choice; try to forget her own loneliness when he
should be absorbed in someone else and forget her,
as was natural, as all men did forget their families
when once they were married.</p>

<p>A little hand was laid against her arm, a little
voice with compassion in it was urging her to listen.
In the light of what had gone before, Miriam had
understood Milcah&#8217;s remarks as Rachel could not;
had comprehended Milcah&#8217;s thoughts from the despair
on her countenance, and now came to the rescue
of both. With a thrill of being at last needed she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
realized that she held the key to an embarrassing
situation. How much more she knew of the whole
matter than anyone else present! She could guess
why Isaac had come. Had he not promised to take
care of Rachel for Benjamin, to whom he was indebted?
Into an atmosphere thick with misunderstanding,
Miriam volubly poured her explanations.</p>

<p>And now, she concluded, Isaac had gone to bring
Benjamin, to whom Rachel was betrothed, lacking
only the public acknowledgment. Not until Rachel
told her did Miriam know he was also in Syria, a
captive with his flock, Isaac having spared to tell
her lest she grieve for the desolation of her parents.
Her voice choked. But now that Rachel had no
home (Rebekah winced), she was glad he was
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thinkest thou he will come?&#8221; asked Rebekah&#8217;s
friend, sharply. &#8220;Will he not resent the&mdash;the&mdash;interest
of the soldier?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel answered with a trace of indignation. &#8220;He
will be grateful to the soldier, for much kindness
hath Isaac showed me and asked naught in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milcah, likewise indignant at the slur, found herself
liking Rachel immensely. In this maiden&#8217;s
hands her brother&#8217;s reputation was quite safe.</p>

<p>Miriam assured them that he <i>would</i> come and
that without delay, and went on to add numberless
details which bore the manifest stamp of truth, even
to the mention of the sandals she was wearing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
which were so very like a pair Ezekiel had once sent
Rachel.</p>

<p>Long after farewells had been said and the
visitors had departed, Rachel caressed the grass-woven
bracelet strung from a chain around her neck,
oblivious to comments, unheeding the low-toned conference
between Rebekah and her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minute I saw her with him,&#8221; Rebekah was
saying, &#8220;never did I doubt either of them nor the
tale they told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; agreed her friend, &#8220;and she with looks
and ways so like Ezekiel, as we have often said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well do I remember,&#8221; continued Rebekah, &#8220;the
gifts he sent to Israel and with what praise he spoke
of this young kinswoman! The child, Miriam, recalleth
it to my mind. A lovable little maid! Ah me,
how fast they grow! To think I should not have
known Isaac, a man now and an officer, when as a
lad his sister hath oft brought him to the shop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only the maiden were betrothed to the
soldier!&#8221; sighed the friend, &#8220;but to a wandering
shepherd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; Rebekah answered, sorrowfully, &#8220;and a
sad day will it be for Amos and me when we shall
have to lose our sweet little Rachel!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That visit changed Miriam&#8217;s whole attitude toward
her new life. Although her longing for her
parents and the old familiar faces and places remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
almost overpowering at times, yet in Rachel&#8217;s
presence and Benjamin&#8217;s nearness she discovered
comforting home ties. The certainty that
her brother would soon be in Damascus and that she
was free to visit her friend, did much to bring contentment.
A captive she might be, but not a prisoner.
The color began to come back to the pale
cheeks; she grew more cheerful and energetic, more
diligent in seeking ways of usefulness, and that is
how it happened that she had an adventure while
Isaac was gone. She walked straight through the
Closed Door and stepped&mdash;not on but still further
into&mdash;Milcah&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>It was Memory that opened the door and Kindness
which escorted her over the threshold, and it
all came about through her new timbrel. She was
singing in the courtyard and inadvertently paused
near the Closed Door.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Show me thy ways, O Lord;</div>
<div class="indent">Teach me thy paths.</div>
<div class="verse">Guide me in thy truth and teach me;</div>
<div class="verse">For thou art the God of my salvation;</div>
<div class="verse">For thee do I wait all the day.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Looking up, she was startled to find Milcah at
hand with a hesitant invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never told thee before and asked Isaac not to
let thee know that our mother is living, lest thou annoy
her. She is old and bedridden, and I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
she would not enjoy having a child around, but to-day
she hath heard thee singing the Lord&#8217;s songs in
which she rejoiceth and hath asked that thou
shouldst be brought to her. Dost thou wish to go?
She is a native of Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me quickly, Milcah. I would be so very
glad to sing to her,&#8221; and though the woman looked
incredulous, she did not delay.</p>

<p>Behind the Closed Door was a sight that ordinarily
would not appeal to youth, for age is not beautiful
in the East. Wrinkled, bald, toothless and
feeble, it excited compassion in the heart of the little
visitor. She went to the bed and spoke kindly,
stooping to peer into the weak eyes and to pat the
worn hand. Then, at a command, she picked up
her timbrel and sang again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Blessed be the Lord,</div>
<div class="verse">Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</div>
<div class="verse">The Lord is my strength and my shield,</div>
<div class="verse">In him hath my heart trusted,</div>
<div class="verse">And I am helped;</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth,</div>
<div class="verse">And with my song will I praise him.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>That was only the beginning: the beginning of
that particular visit and of others which followed,
and in between the songs were snatches of conversation
in the speech of Israel. In her youth the invalid
had been a resident of Tish-bi (or Tish-beh) in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Gilead, the cattle country east of the Jordan, in
whose fertile valleys grew the spicy herbs for medicine
and perfume which had made her land famous
all over the East.</p>

<p>In her village were the home and kinsfolk of
Elijah, the prophet of Jehovah, whom she well remembered
with his long, thick hair, his girdle of
skins and his sheepskin mantle or cloak, and more
than one tale did she tell of his prowess in strength,
for, exposed to the raids of the fierce desert tribes
as was Gilead on the east, every man must be a
soldier at need. She told of the prophet&#8217;s earnestness
and eloquence, his stormy moods of exaltation
and despair, his wanderings, his sudden reappearances
where least expected, his invectives against
Baal by which he had roused the ire of the foreign
Queen Jezebel, his miraculous escapes from personal
danger and the staggering blow he finally gave
Baal-worship on Mount Carmel.</p>

<p>Only through Miriam&#8217;s eyes, however, did she
know Elijah&#8217;s successor, Elisha the Healer, the civilized
man who dwelt in cities, who for the most
part went about displaying the loving-kindness of
Jehovah rather than his terrible might; whose task
it was to build up as Elijah&#8217;s had been to destroy;
who established the prophetic Guilds wherein the
Law which had been so long forgotten was once
more taught. And then Miriam and her new friend
fell into more personal confidences, comparing notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
as to their coming to Syria, their impressions, their
longings, weeping and smiling together and parting
only to visit again at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Thus did Hope, nature&#8217;s most renowned and successful
physician, undertake the cure of the little
maid&#8217;s wounded heart as, far away, it was doing
likewise for her mother, though Miriam knew it
not.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


HANNATHON</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village or &#8220;city&#8221; of Hannathon in the Land
of Israel saw startling changes as a result of the
Syrian raid. Gone were the flocks and herds; gone
were the stores of oil and wine; gone was the lately
garnered grain, and they who had journeyed to
Jerusalem to the feast returned to scant supplies.
It was Eli who waited for them at the foot of the
hill and broke the news to the little companies as they
arrived, but Caleb, father of Miriam, came not.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tarrieth a day or two behind us,&#8221; said his
friends, and Eli waited impatiently one day and a
second and yet a third after the last of his townsmen
had straggled up the hill. Then it was Sarah,
and not Caleb, who met his view, riding dejectedly
her faithful and weary beast and leading the other,
on the back of which was bound something still and
covered.</p>

<p>As Caleb had traveled, making what haste he
could in pleasant anticipation of home and family,
he had been set upon by thieves. He had not risen
from the narrow, rocky road in which he had fallen
from the blows of the robber band, but the timely
arrival of other pilgrims had doubtless saved her
from the same fate. They had dragged his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
into a convenient cave while they tried frantically
to restore breathing, but finding it quite useless they
had bound the burden to the back of his patient ass
and accompanied her to within sight of Hannathon.</p>

<p>In the pitiful horror of her tale Eli felt that his
own was matched. If he could only spare her! But
he could not, and told her as tenderly as possible.
She listened numbly, without exclamation, without
tears. It was as if brain and nerves had already
borne more than they could take cognizance of.
After a time he helped her up the hill, where Judith
was waiting; waiting in dread of the displeasure she
knew she merited, yet keyed up to defiance. There
was, however, no harsh rebuke. In fact, Sarah
seemed scarcely to recognize her as she leaned
heavily upon Eli. Hastily Judith unrolled the
thickly padded rug or quilt which served as a bed
and the two laid her upon it. Without a word she
turned her face to the wall and Eli beckoned the
girl to the door, where he whispered the sad news
concerning Caleb.</p>

<p>Later in the day a crowd of white-faced men and
women laid the body reverently away and sealed the
rocky tomb with a heavy stone. Sarah, on her bed,
appeared unconscious of all that passed, and Judith
would not leave her. After doing a hundred things
which occurred to her as necessary for the bodily
comfort of her kinswoman, the girl patiently
watched the long night through, the one witness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Sarah&#8217;s dumb agony. Eli was, of course, with his
mother. A neighbor, coming to offer her services,
had said that Hannah might not live.</p>

<p>Mad fancies took possession of Judith that awful
night. She had the feeling that every hour was a
year and that, by morning, she would be an old, old
woman. Again, she was a mother, brooding over a
sick babe, and she stroked the head on the mattress
and murmured soothing words. At other times she
had a wild desire to shriek, to tear her hair, to stamp
and rave, but in the presence of that awful stillness
came peace. In the gray of the morning she opened
the heavy front door and let in a stream of sweet,
cool air. As she stood there her mind cleared.</p>

<p>There was something tangible about that long
street with its flat-roofed houses, seen dimly through
the mist; there was something tangible about that
silvery rim rising higher and higher in the east and
gradually dissipating the shadows; there was something
tangible in the chill wind that swept over and
around her. In a little while she would go for fuel.
They would enjoy the warmth of a fire even if there
was little to eat. As she turned back into the house
Sarah broke her long silence. She was holding
something in her hand and peering at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither husband nor son,&#8221; she was saying in a
voice very unlike her own, &#8220;but this&mdash;<i>this</i>&mdash;which
can avail nothing; this for which hath been spent
the earnings of years; this for which Caleb was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
slain and which was yet not found because I had
hidden it; this which hath no power to avenge my
daughter or to bring me back my loved ones or to
do aught but torment with its impotency.&#8221;</p>

<p>Raising up on her elbow, she threw out of the
door whatever it was she held in her hand, and lay
back exhausted. After a moment she went on in
that strangely rambling tone: &#8220;Neither husband
nor son to avenge the captivity of my daughter;
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall form stood in the doorway. It was Eli. At
the words he came forward and bent over the figure
on the pallet, his hot tears dropping on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The son who is without a mother shall care for
the mother who is without a son. An hour ago
my mother fell victim to the soldier&#8217;s sword.&#8221; He
clinched his hands and drew a long, sobbing breath.
&#8220;I will avenge thy daughter and my brother and my
mother. For one thing only will I live henceforth:
to follow into Syria those who are gone; to find them
and to secure their ransom. Their sorrows shall be
mine; their weeping shall be even as mine own, and
woe unto him by whom they were taken!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman seemed strangely excited. She rose
unsteadily and tottered to the door. &#8220;I threw away
that which would help thee to accomplish thy vow.
It was a pearl, a pearl of great price which we
brought from Jerusalem, meaning to give it to
Miriam when she is older.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Attempting to cross the threshold she fell, overborne
by lack of nourishment, weariness and grief.
Eli raised her with his one good arm and he and
Judith again laid her on the bed. He lingered, speaking
comforting words the while: &#8220;When it is fully
light we will look for thy pearl. Fear not, it shall
be found. Judith and I will seek&mdash;&#8221; but Judith was
slipping hastily away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go for firewood,&#8221; she explained, and partially
closed the door behind her. Once outside and assured
that Eli still sat beside her aunt, she sank to
her knees and groped upon the ground. Handfuls
of earth, sticks and stones, thorns and stinging ants
rewarded her search, but she cared not. The sun
rose higher and she lifted her head in smiling thankfulness.
At last she rose, rejoicing, clutching something
in her hand, hugging it to her bosom.</p>

<p>She was about to re-enter the house when, far below
her, she espied the familiar figure of a man. In
demonstrative Eastern fashion he was beating his
breast and pouring dust upon his head, customs indicative
of overwhelming sorrow. The girl suddenly
changed her mind and went down the hill,
passing the man but paying no attention to him.
Half an hour later he passed her where she was industriously
and demurely gathering brush. In the
common calamity Eastern etiquette might well be
disregarded. He stopped to speak to her as though
she had been a man and an equal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;Woe is me,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Gone are my flocks and
herds; gone are my stores of wine and olives; gone
is my newly garnered grain; naught remaineth but
the bare fields wherewith to mock me while famine
and sickness and death stare our village in the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to mock thee, my lord,&#8221; she replied, her
voice low from nervousness and the fear of being
overheard by some unsuspected passer-by, &#8220;not to
mock thee do thy fields stare thee in the face, but to
save us from the disasters thou dost mention.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tones held surprise and a certain amount of
incredulity. &#8220;A prudent mind is thine, but long will
it be until next harvest, and how shall we live
until then?&#8221; He regarded her shrewdly while she
made answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;In our house is a little food; in Hannah&#8217;s a little
more; probably some remaineth in every dwelling.
Do thou go quickly, my lord, gather up whatever
there be and put it in thy storehouse. Then it shall
be that day by day the people shall come unto thee
for food and thou shalt apportion it, so-much and
so-much for each person. Thus shall the gluttonous
divide with him that hath little and so shall all be
fed. Fear not, thou shalt plant and reap in due time.
Hasten, my lord, the village waiteth upon thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his eyes was frank admiration. &#8220;Wise are thy
words and quickly will I do as thou sayest, but how
thinkest thou I can plant without seed and reap with
nothing wherewith to sow?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Judith&#8217;s hand opened and trembling a little she
held before his dazzled eyes the pearl she had just
found: &#8220;A jewel, my lord, given unto me by my
father and kept hidden until now. Do thou take it
and go unto other cities and buy seed. So shalt
thou and I and the village be saved from death and
thy prosperity come again. Only, I pray thee, tell
no one whence came the pearl.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, a world of entreaty in her manner.
He assented, his hand clutching the jewel, but his
eyes fastened upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most discreet art thou of all the women of Israel
and long hath my soul cleaved unto thee. I
will do as thou sayest, and when I return it shall be,
if thou thinkest well, that I shall ask for thee at the
hands of thy kinswoman, Sarah, and thou shalt be
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith stooped without haste and picked up her
bundle of brush. &#8220;Yea, my lord,&#8221; she murmured,
preparing to leave him and dropping her eyelids to
hide an exultant gleam, &#8220;thy servant shall be obedient
unto thy wishes in the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halfway up the hill she paused and looked back.
He was diligently examining the pearl. Her lip
curled slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy <i>soul</i> cleaveth unto me, thou sayest? Nay,
for hereabouts they say thou hast none.&#8221; She
laughed to herself. &#8220;When a faithless Israelite taketh
unto himself a wife who is a &#8216;heathen&#8217; they who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
know us will say that no worse fate could come to
either. And when the two who are most despised
form an alliance, each should know that there is no
friend save in the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun had risen fully when Judith returned to
the house. Eli, groping unavailingly upon the
ground, drew her aside for a whispered word. &#8220;No
pearl can I find and she had not strength to throw
it far. Thinkest thou she had the jewel but in a
dream? Thinkest thou that sorrow hath affected
her mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl drew a breath of relief and letting fall the
brush pretended to assist him in the search. &#8220;Yea,&#8221;
she assented with apparent reluctance, &#8220;surely it is
as thou sayest, and she but dreamed. As if she
would cast away a valuable pearl! Nay, but thou
hast spoken the truth,&#8221; and sighing heavily she
passed into the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Adah, wife of Naaman, was slightly indisposed.
Restlessly she tossed on her silken pillow, wooing
in vain the sleep which came fitfully and with disturbing
dreams. Her attendant had departed on
some errand when through the open door there stole
a small shadow. Softly it moved about the room for
a few moments, touching this and changing that,
then it came and stood over the fair form of the
mistress of this magnificent home. It stooped,
straightened up as if considering, then bent hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and kissed gently each eyelid. The eyes flew open
in bewilderment and at the same moment a delighted
little voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it would. It never faileth. I have been
looking at thee for a long time through the open
door and thou wert so restless I thought it better to
wake thee up entirely while I give thee a fresh, cool
pillow,&#8221; suiting the action to the word, &#8220;then will I
kiss each eyelid again and thou wilt go straight to
sleep. Dost thou notice how I have propped these
other pillows to shut out the light, and drawn the
curtains so they will sway with the breeze and make
thee think thou art breathing the sweet air of the
courtyard? There, I have smoothed thy robes and
thou wilt be much more comfortable. Now, a kiss
here&mdash;and one on this eye&mdash;nay, open them not; thou
must not get too wide awake, for I have not time
to sing thee to sleep to-day. There&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The object of these unexpected attentions drew a
satisfied sigh. It was pleasant to be put so entirely
at ease without having to think about it at all. The
others fussed so and it grew monotonous to be giving
directions continually. She had never been taken
possession of in just this way before. Everybody
else&mdash;even Milcah&mdash;was so irritatingly anxious to
be dignified and proper. There was nothing disrespectful
in these quiet tones. It merely showed sense.
A moment later there floated through her drowsy
consciousness the startling intelligence that this must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
be the little maid of Israel whom she had so dreaded
until &#8220;trained.&#8221; Taking care not to open the eyes
so surprisingly closed, the lady murmured a command
to stay right there lest she should want something
farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to,&#8221; Miriam answered serenely,
&#8220;but thou hast everything thou wilt need for quite
awhile because thou wilt be asleep. I have to take
my timbrel now and sing to Milcah&#8217;s mother. She is
much, much older than thou and needeth me much,
much more, but I will come again to see thee when
I can spare the time,&#8221; with which cheerful assurance
Miriam betook herself off with the gladness of
being at last wanted.</p>

<p>Her newest acquaintance, so unceremoniously disobeyed
for the sake of duty, lay there smiling and
then&mdash;to her own amazement as she thought about
it afterward&mdash;actually went to sleep as she was bidden
and awoke refreshed, as the little maid had said.
She awoke too with a delightful sensation of anticipation,
wondering how and when this astonishing
child would keep her promise of another visit.
Nay, she would not send for her lest it mar the
charming spontaneity of the occasion and, had
Miriam but known of this, she might also have
known that Adah was not accustomed to looking forward
with pleasure. To her, life had become a
weary round of sameness with dread calamity as its
certain goal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


CONFESSION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> out on the Syrian hills a shepherd
was engaged in a most interesting occupation. At
the door of the sheepfold he was holding a light rod,
forked at one end, under which the flock passed as
he counted. It was always the last task of the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven. So
far nothing hath disturbed thee through the day
now gone. Seventy-eight, seventy-nine. Nay, Master
Bold, thou wilt wait thy turn. Eighty, eighty-one,
eighty-two. Come, thou timid one, thy mother
is already in and calleth for thee. Eighty-three,
eighty-four, eighty-five. Now, Bright Eyes, what
mischief art thou up to? This rod is a means of
counting, but it can be turned into a means of punishment
if it be necessary to make thee see thy duty.
Eighty-six, eighty-seven. Nay, not so much crowding
there. Youth is eager, knowing not that time is
long and weariness certain. Eighty-eight, eighty-nine,
ninety. What, my pearl, the heat of the day
hath been too much for thee? Wait thou.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd hastily dipped his fingers in the horn
of olive oil that hung at his belt and anointed its
temples.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;There, so shalt thou be refreshed, and here, do
thou drink of this cup of cold water which overfloweth
for thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The needy one attended to, he went on with his
count of the others. &#8220;Ninety-one, ninety-two&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Two horsemen approached, the one behind leading
a third animal which was without a rider. At a
sign, the one with the led horse halted while the
other dismounted and with some impatience waited
until the long enumeration was finished. Then he
advanced toward the shepherd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace be unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to thee,&#8221; the shepherd made answer. &#8220;Thou
art in uniform. Hast thou orders for thy servant?
Quickly, thy name and errand. One of my sheep
hath strayed and I go to seek it, hastening lest the
darkness descend and I be unable to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well thou knowest, Benjamin, that I am Isaac,
servant to Naaman, commander-in-chief of the
armies of Syria, but I come on a private and not on
an official errand. Lead thou the way and I will go
with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence broken at last by
the soldier: &#8220;Thou art looking somewhat haggard
since I saw thee last, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have passed through much sorrow of spirit,
Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely thou hast no fault to find with thy
treatment. Thou hast a well-built sheepfold: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
long, low buildings to shelter thy flock in storms,
the large space for them to roam in when thou dost
not bring them to pasture, and the whole surrounded
by wide stone walls, surmounted by sharp thorns
to keep out wild beasts. Nor have we a hard master
to serve. Thy faithfulness and ability will be
noted by those who have charge of such matters for
the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd&#8217;s tones were infinitely sad: &#8220;Could
any reward compensate my parents for the loss of
their only son; for their loneliness and grief and
real need of me? Could any reward make up to my
little sister for the brother who should guard and
guide her? Could any reward atone to me for the
loss of my well-beloved, my betrothed?&#8221;</p>

<p>The light was already dim as they stumbled over
the rocks and through patches of woodland, the long
briars catching at their garments and tearing the
flesh. They passed another sheepfold. Benjamin
raised his voice in a shout: &#8220;Hast thou found a
sheep which is lost?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly the answer came back: &#8220;Nay, we have
none but our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sighing, the shepherd went on, the soldier abreast
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to redeem my pledge, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other&#8217;s face was sadly accusing. &#8220;Here, on
these lonely hills, with only the fast-falling night
for a witness, and not before the eyes of men?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>The soldier&#8217;s face flushed. &#8220;If thou meanest our
last meeting on the way hither, I had thought thou
wouldst understand. It was through no information
furnished by me that thou wert taken, nor was it by
my band. Naaman is Captain of the Host. I have
but a few men under me and my authority is small.
I could not help thee then. Besides, thou wert in
no personal danger, else I would have risked it. It
was thy flock of which Eleazer&#8217;s company was so
proud. They took thee because the sheep knew thy
voice but a stranger would they not follow, fleeing
from any but thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>A contemptuous smile played around Benjamin&#8217;s
mouth. He unclasped from his wrist a broad gold
bracelet and handed it to Isaac.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought thou wouldst be apt to consider this
too costly a token,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A pained look crossed Isaac&#8217;s face. &#8220;I redeem it
with what hath cost me more: the delight of a
woman&#8217;s presence and a woman&#8217;s sweetness and a
woman&#8217;s wonderful devotion which otherwise might
have been mine. I have come to invite thee to a
wedding&mdash;thine own wedding&mdash;with Rachel of
Hannathon in the Land of Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd was plainly startled. &#8220;Thou hast
come to ask me to marry my betrothed? I do not
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was captured about the time thou wert by
one of the men in my company,&#8221; the soldier explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
&#8220;I am glad to say I was able to save her
from familiarity at the hands of the soldiers&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For which I am grateful to thee, Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But three days&#8217; journey from Damascus she left
us with another captive, a young lad called &#8216;Nathan,&#8217;
being sore afraid. By accident I discovered her
hiding place, but knew not it was the maid of my
dreams, she being enveloped in her wedding veil,
as I afterward learned it was. Nevertheless, I discovered
her identity in time to soften the hardships
of the journey with food and water, together with
the leopard&#8217;s skin thou gavest me, her clothing being
insufficient protection against the cold winds which
swept down from the Lebanons. I was quite sure
the two would come to Damascus, so I had the gate
watched and word brought to me of her arrival. She
appeared to be alone, the boy having disappeared,
and though she had wandered far out of her way in
the city, I found her after some search and conducted
her, as she desired, to the street of the merchants of
Israel. Her kinsman, however, whom we sought,
had died a month before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin&#8217;s voice betrayed uneasiness. &#8220;And
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I found lodging for her in the house
of one, Amos the perfumer, also of Israel, since
which time she hath been there cared for, provided
with necessary raiment and awaiteth thee, desiring
that thou come quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Benjamin&#8217;s attitude became questioning. &#8220;It is
now the height of the rainy season. All this occurred
months ago and I hear but now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art hearing as soon as it was convenient
for me to bring thee word. Am I in a place of authority?
Do I not come and go at another&#8217;s bidding?
Besides, it was but little more than a week ago that
she told me of the whispered conversations which
always break off when she appeareth, the averted
glances and, almost worse than this, the pitying kindness
of her friends&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd&#8217;s face grew white and stern.
&#8220;Then didst thou think it was time to send for the
one who would not fail her? I suppose, Isaac, <i>thou</i>
hast not thought of marrying the maiden&mdash;considering
the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier sought to restrain his anger. &#8220;I did,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;or at least I would have had it not
been for another maiden to whom I would have
found it hard to explain matters. This other&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it all,&#8221; the shepherd responded, bitterly.
&#8220;Having a little authority and noting that the maid
was fair, she was thy lawful prey, whereas the
maiden who is surrounded by care and affection thou
canst not bear to offend. My little Rachel, pure as
the snows of Hermon, and entirely at thy mercy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his stout staff. The soldier threw up
one arm to ward off the blow but he did not draw
the short sword which hung at his girdle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;Thou dost not let me make myself clear,&#8221; he said,
gently, &#8220;but thou shalt know for thyself. And another
sorrow I have unwittingly brought thee. At
the same time that Rachel was taken by my band,
Miriam was also captured, although I knew not she
was thy sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin lowered his staff, grief succeeding indignation.
&#8220;And what of her? Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have myself seen to her welfare, and my errand
here is to tell thee of both maidens and to
conduct thee to them that thou mayest assure
thyself&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin assented briefly. At that moment his
keen ear detected the far-off bleat of a sheep.
Guided by its cries, he made his way to it as quickly
as possible and with his light, hooked rod disentangled
its wool from the cruel thorns which caught
and tore his own flesh meanwhile. Catching the
forelegs together with one hand and the hindlegs
with the other, he swung the exhausted animal over
his shoulder and began retracing his steps. Isaac
followed, a dozen times essaying to reopen the subject
upon which he had come prepared to speak, and
a dozen times being repulsed by the gloom in which
Benjamin seemed wrapped.</p>

<p>They passed the sheepfold where inquiry had
earlier been made and the shepherd raised his voice
in a shout, &#8220;Rejoice with me, for I have found my
sheep that was lost.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Arriving at last whence they had started and the
weary and injured animal tenderly cared for, Isaac
and Benjamin took opposite sides of the fire, each
preferring the company of his own bitter thoughts
to conversation. A recumbent shepherd kept watch
before the door of the fold. Two more slept. To
use the tongue of Israel would have been to insure
privacy to the message, but each waited for the other.
If Isaac were sufficiently penitent, thought Benjamin,
he would talk even though the words came falteringly.
As it was, his errand was one of expediency
and no real satisfaction would be gained by forcing
from his lips details of the confession he should
make voluntarily. If, thought Isaac, Benjamin
wished to ask questions, he would answer them fully,
but why give unasked information which was distorted
and misunderstood as soon as uttered? And
so, each nursing a sense of injury, the long night
passed.</p>

<p>A couple of days were spent in making preparation
for the care of the flock while Benjamin should
be away, and the fourth they started for Damascus.
At dawn a gentle rain was falling. The substitute
shepherd was delighted. Since the flock must remain
within shelter of the fold while the storm
lasted, it were that much easier cared for. To the
three whose horses stood waiting, the rain mattered
not at all. Benjamin moved here and there, giving
directions and making sure that all was well before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
his departure. Once he paused and took a sick lamb
in his arms:</p>

<p>&#8220;I go to bring another,&#8221; he whispered, tenderly,
&#8220;bruised and wounded as thou art, but her spirit,
like thine, shall be healed with the oil of loving-kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later he was riding across the rain-soaked
plain, the other horseman a little in advance,
the servant in the rear. The two foremost were quite
unchanged, the one lost in the depths of profound
irritation, the other in melancholy, and neither speaking
save when their common errand made it necessary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miriam took an early opportunity of again calling
upon the mistress of the household. She felt no
sense of obligation beyond her promise. The visit
was entirely a friendly one and was so understood.
On the threshold she paused with a bright smile
of greeting, which was cordially returned. Entering,
she found a cushion of the right height, threw
it upon the floor and sat down, resting her arms confidingly
on Adah&#8217;s lap, studying the face above hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have noticed how sad thou art, and I think it
is the way thy house is built. Thou wouldst not be
nearly so lonely if thy dwelling were like ours in
Israel: all in one big room with the animals in one
part and the family on a raised floor in the other.
Of course thou hast too large a household for that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
but thou dost not know how comforting it is to
hear the animals stamping around in their stalls at
night and on rainy days. Here it is so quiet I cannot
sleep sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah frequently did not sleep, but she had never
attributed it to the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;If thou couldst but rise early in the morning,&#8221;
Miriam continued with animation, &#8220;and grind the
wheat&mdash;thou art so rich thou couldst have an ass
or a camel harnessed to the mill to do the hardest
part of the work&mdash;and if thou couldst make up the
dough quickly and bake it in cakes for thy family&#8217;s
breakfast, it would give thee so much delight. Hast
thou never tried it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the pleasure of toil, Miriam, but I have
sometimes wondered&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if thou wouldst pretend to find fault because
thy bread is eaten so fast and thy husband
would pretend to find fault because thou hast not
baked enough, and he would caress thee and say
thou canst bake the best bread to be found in any
house in Israel&mdash;I mean in Syria&mdash;it would be such
joy to thee. Hast thou never known this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the joy of service, Miriam, but I have often
thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if thou didst see to the clothing of thy entire
household instead of having Milcah do it for thee;
I mean the spinning and weaving and washing, and
couldst look after the conduct and instruction of thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
men servants and thy maid servants. If, while thy
husband sits in the gate, judging the cause of the
people, thou wert also considering the needs of the
poor, thou wouldst never have time to be sad. Hast
thou never done these things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not enough to give me the happiness of being
necessary, but I have sometimes envied those who
were.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah recollected herself with a start. To be making
such undignified admissions! Her countenance
settled back into its old lines of haughty indifference
and Miriam was quick to notice the change. She
took the older face tenderly between her hands and
kissed it, quite unaware that she was not expected
to take such liberties. Her voice was full of
pity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou dost look so sorrowful. I never knew before
how much thou dost need me. I can teach thee
so much. I will show thee how to be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah thought it extremely doubtful, but it would
have been cruel to discourage such cheerful confidence.
Besides, she saw a loophole of escape from
an embarrassing conversation: &#8220;Thou hast no time
to give to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam pondered. &#8220;I will take time,&#8221; she said
with decision, &#8220;just as much as I can spare from
Isaac and Milcah and their mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran to the door and looked appraisingly at
the position of the sun on the courtyard foliage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;I must go now,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it groweth late. See
how the shadows lengthen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah, left alone, smiled, then she sighed. Alas,
that the sorrow of the House of Naaman should be
past the little maid&#8217;s generously offered assistance,
past the ability of the wisest men and the greatest
gods of Syria!</p>

UNDERSTANDING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> on the Syrian plains three horsemen plodded
steadily through the storm. At last they halted,
shivering, in the shelter of a great rock. One went
about the necessary preparations for a slender meal,
another faced his companion contritely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry, Benjamin. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We usually are, Isaac, when we see what sorrow
is wrought by our wrongdoing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been trying to put myself in thy place,
Benjamin. I can realize something of what thou
hast suffered. I admit that it is all my fault that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never thought of blaming anyone else,
Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; impatiently, &#8220;that thou wouldst let me
explain. I was greatly surprised that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it, Isaac. We go along doing what
we want instead of what we ought, and we are always
surprised when God&#8217;s &#8216;Thou shalt not&#8217; makes
us stop and think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other made a gesture of despair. &#8220;Have I
lost thy confidence entirely? If thou wouldst but
let <i>me</i> tell the story instead of telling it thyself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
thine own way, thou wouldst be better prepared&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel and I have been companions since babyhood,
Isaac, and never have I been unprepared for
her lightest wish, nor am I unprepared now for her
dire distress. As for my sister, it will go hard with
thee if thou hast allowed ill to come to a child.&#8221; He
closed his lips in a way that revealed both strength
and determination.</p>

<p>The soldier faced him without flinching. &#8220;We
near Damascus,&#8221; he said, coldly, &#8220;and it is
necessary that we speak of certain arrangements.
We wish to observe the usual customs, but our situation
is peculiar: that which is usually furnished by
the family of the maiden we must ourselves provide.
Rachel will need festive robes and a veil and a girdle
and a chaplet for her flowing hair, not mentioning
the perfumery and the jewels which every bride desireth,
and saying nothing, also, of <i>thy</i> festive robe
and nuptial wreath and the myrrh and frankincense
for thine adorning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd buried his face in his hands. &#8220;Not
once have I thought of these things, but only of her
need of me. And I a captive, without even a trinket
I can sell, and my flock the stolen property of an
enemy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac tapped the bracelet so lately transferred
from the other&#8217;s arm to his own. &#8220;I anticipated
this when I asked for my pledge. When sold, as I
intend it shall be, it will provide all and more, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
I am curious to know why thou wert allowed to keep
the token. Eleazer&#8217;s band which took thee is not
noted for its gentleness nor its generosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not the reason, Isaac, save that I fought
for it once and twice and thrice and was not overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was abstracted; now it became passionate:
&#8220;But thinkest thou I would take so much from
thee&mdash;from <i>thee</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac spoke soothingly: &#8220;Peradventure not for
my sake, Benjamin, but for Rachel&mdash;whom we both
love!&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd looked up quickly. &#8220;Love?&#8221; he
queried, his mood changing to contempt. &#8220;But the
other maiden more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac laughed. &#8220;The other maiden&mdash;&#8221; All at
once he became serious. &#8220;Thou wilt understand
when I tell thee&mdash;&#8221; but a glance at his companion&#8217;s
forbidding countenance caused him to shut his lips
in a grimness which was not lost in their short resting
time, nor in the several miles which they traveled,
nor even in Damascus itself. Only once was there
speech between them and that was as they entered
the city gates.</p>

<p>It was Benjamin who broke the silence. &#8220;Thou
hast told me of Rachel, but not of my sister. Take
me, therefore, first to Miriam that I may know for
myself how she fareth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac bent his head stiffly. &#8220;It is well,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
and led the way to the largest and most magnificent
dwelling the shepherd had ever beheld.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To her mistress, Miriam spoke Syrian as far as
possible; to Milcah, either Syrian or the speech of
Israel, more often a mixture of the two, but to Milcah&#8217;s
mother it was joy unspeakable to use only her
native tongue. Unfortunately, this pleasure was
not to last. The feeble strength waned fast, and
one morning Miriam ran swiftly to Milcah, imploring
her to hasten to the invalid. She herself sped
to the gatekeeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do thou send to the barracks and there leave
word that Isaac come home as soon as he arriveth
in Damascus. His mother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>For reply the gatekeeper pointed to the street.
In company with two others he was just dismounting.
The gate was opened for them and a breathless
little figure, tense with excitement, rushed into
his arms, unmindful of his companions.</p>

<p>He bent his head over hers for a moment, listening
to her broken words, then, with a courteous explanation
to the stranger, he hurried down the courtyard
and turned into that in which his mother&#8217;s room
was located. Miriam started to follow, her mind
intent upon this new grief, but a hand touched her
on the shoulder and she looked into the brown,
questioning face of her brother.</p>

<p>The warmth of her welcome left him no room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
for jealousy of Isaac. Both faces beamed as
genially as the sun, which had finally succeeded in
dispersing the clouds and drying up the rain drops.
She guided her visitor to the spot that she and Isaac
liked, the seat under the damson tree near the fountain.
He gazed in wonder at his surroundings, at
the richness and beauty everywhere, marveling that
she seemed so much at ease amid all this magnificence.
It was so different from what he had
expected to find, nor could he understand the greeting
he had just witnessed between herself and Isaac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou not afraid of the man who took thee
captive?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Radiant with the happiness of her brother&#8217;s coming
and clinging to him as if he were a pleasant
dream which might be lost, she answered quite serenely:
&#8220;Afraid of Isaac? Nay, thou canst not fear
one who loveth someone thou dost love.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought she referred to Rachel and it was like
the thrust of a knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever conscious is he, Benjamin, of the debt he
oweth thee. He hath told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd was bitterly incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before thou seest Rachel,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I must
tell thee something she knoweth not I have learned.&#8221;</p>

<p>A stern look crept into Benjamin&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rachel liketh Isaac very much indeed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd paled. This possibility had not
occurred to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;But I think Isaac liketh her not at all, else he
would have visited her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin uttered an exclamation, but she was
too full of the importance of her discovery to pay
attention. She continued impressively, looking
around to make sure she was not overheard:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not since he found her, cold and tired and hungry,
just outside this wall one daybreak and conducted
her to the street of the merchants of Israel,
where Amos and Rebekah took pity upon her distress,
never once did she see him until the morning.
I went with Milcah and we found him talking to her
on the footway. He had stopped just a moment to
tell her that he and his servant were starting to bring
thee. I think he would have done nothing for her
at all, not even on the way hither, if she had not
been thy betrothed. He would not even promise to
help her when I first asked. Wouldst thou not have
supposed he would consider her as sweet and beautiful
as thou dost and I?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd was too bewildered to reply at once.
&#8220;Art thou very sure of what thou sayest?&#8221; he finally
stammered, an odd excitement in his manner. &#8220;Thy
words sound strange to mine ears. I would hear all
thou knowest,&#8221; and Miriam was very obliging.</p>

<p>Beginning with the last time he had visited their
home in Israel (which had been a few days before
their parents went to the feast at Jerusalem; when
he and Rachel had come to a full understanding),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
she told him all that had befallen her and what she
knew concerning Rachel. He heard with varying
emotions, and all too soon Isaac stood before them.
On his face was the dignity of sorrow. The gladness
died out of Miriam&#8217;s countenance; his grief
was hers. He pressed the hand she slipped into his
and addressed Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&mdash;&#8221; he began and his voice broke. In
a moment he went on: &#8220;My servant will conduct
thee to Rachel and attend upon thee. After the custom
of our people I must remain in seclusion until
after our period of mourning hath ended. Nevertheless,
the House of Naaman is thine abode as long
as thou art in Damascus and whenever thou comest
hither. My home is thine. And this I give into
thy keeping for the purpose of which we spoke. I
will instruct my servant regarding its disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He unclasped the bracelet from his arm and for
the second time gave it to the shepherd, but his
present manner bore no resemblance to the first.
Something of the difference occurred to Benjamin.
He called after the retreating figure. He ran and
placed himself before Isaac, bowing low before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy servant hath misjudged thee. Forgive, I
pray thee. What am I that thou shouldst show such
kindness unto me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd&#8217;s voice faltered before the other&#8217;s
coldly courteous manner. He went on almost
timidly: &#8220;My sister hath explained much that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
could not understand hitherto. Surprise and perplexity
hath gone and in their stead hath come
shame. I would that thou shouldst overlook&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The cold steel of Isaac&#8217;s eye might have been the
cold steel of a weapon piercing Benjamin&#8217;s heart,
the effect being much the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou didst once save my life, which is precious
unto me, and I have given thee that which is dearer
than thy life, thy betrothed. The debt hath been
mutually repaid. Henceforth we owe each other
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears sprang to the shepherd&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Naught
save remembrance and good will. I would that we
might both remember this obligation.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer unless Isaac&#8217;s silence and
his averted head might be construed in the negative.</p>

<p>Benjamin tried again. &#8220;As thou didst once admit
thy guilt to me, so do I now acknowledge to thee
my fault and plead my penitence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late, Benjamin. Thou hast refused to
listen to the confession I sought thee voluntarily to
make. Thou hast assailed my motives with insult.
Thou hast outraged every feeling of affection I ever
had for thee. For the sake of all that is past we
must not allow ourselves to become enemies, but
friends we can never be again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd persevered although seeming to find
speech difficult: &#8220;We are both wrong, Isaac. Should
we permit the winds of trouble to dry up the fountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of loving-kindness and to scatter abroad the
waters of bitterness? Captivity filleth my mind
with suspicion. Resentment causeth thee to hate.
Is it right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac stood immovable, without speaking.
Miriam, where they had left her, ceased her weeping
and running to where the two stood slipped a hand
in each of theirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be so lonely now that Isaac&#8217;s mother hath
gone. Thou wilt stay in Damascus as long as thou
canst, wilt thou not, Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sought to comfort her, yet he could not leave
his duties longer than was necessary. He would
go to Rachel now, the arrangements would be made
for their marriage according to the customs of Israel,
and after the formal betrothal feast he would
hurry back to his flock because it was with an hireling
who cared not for the sheep. When the rainy
season ended he would return to Damascus for his
bride and take her to the home he would prepare
meanwhile. The present arrangements would consume
but a few days. &#8220;But when I am no longer
here I shall think of thee as still being brave, shall
I not, Miriam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; she said, tremulously. &#8220;Thou wilt have
sad enough meditations, longing for Rachel and
thinking of our home in Israel and of father and
mother.&#8221; There was a long pause. &#8220;But thou must
not grieve over me. At first I thought I should die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
here, until I knew that somebody loved me. Now
Milcah doth a little, and I think my mistress will, but
I have never had to wonder about Isaac. He always
hath. He will watch over me as thou wouldst.&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned confidingly against the soldier and he
slipped his arm around her: &#8220;The heart of my little
maid can safely trust in me,&#8221; he assured her.
Then, to Benjamin: &#8220;Behold, the other maid of
whom we spoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam looked up wonderingly, not understanding
Benjamin&#8217;s embarrassment nor Isaac&#8217;s defiance,
but neither troubled her. She smiled upon them impartially.
&#8220;And what hath made it easy for me to
love Isaac,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;is because he loveth thee
so much, Benjamin. It hath made me so happy.
Else I could not bear things even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was caressing their two hands, holding them
to her cheeks and patting them; thus she failed to
see that each young man avoided the other&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love thee both so very much,&#8221; she confided.</p>

<p>They each smiled down upon her indulgently, and
somehow their eyes met&mdash;with the smile still in
them, and this time they did not turn away. Oddly
enough the coldness, the constraint faded before
that look as snow disappears before the genial
warmth of the sun. They parted in a manner quite
satisfactory to the little maid, who beamed upon
them both. Suspicion and resentment had fled before
the affectionate trust of a child!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


CHANGES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of Milcah&#8217;s mother made changes in
the House of Naaman. Adah, its mistress, was inconsolable,
not with grief but with vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Milcah will sit on the floor for a whole week
and mourn! Of course I wish her to treat her
mother&#8217;s memory with respect. I am myself willing
to pay for the mourning men and mourning women.
I will provide the spices and linen in which the body
is to be wrapped. I will even have it laid in the
rocky tomb her people prefer, but I cannot go without
bathing and dressing for a week. Who will see
to my raiment and my perfumes?&#8221;</p>

<p>To Miriam, who had brought the message, this
was a very simple matter. &#8220;Thou hast so many
servants,&#8221; she began, but her mistress interrupted
irritably:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thinkest thou Milcah would instruct any who
might supplant her? Nay, for jealous is she and
sour of disposition, hence doth she keep both my
maidens and me dependent upon her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was genuinely distressed. &#8220;Milcah is
not young and much pain doth she suffer at times,
for she hath told me. Oft hath she waited upon thee
when naught but determination urged her tired footsteps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Many times have I wondered what will become
of her when she is unable to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be taken care of, as was her mother,
and in place of a daughter <i>thou</i> shalt attend upon
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little maid clasped her hands. &#8220;Then will I
be able to show how I love her. Thinkest thou she
will let me make her hair look prettier? When Rachel,
the maiden to whom my brother Benjamin is
betrothed, was sick many weeks I waited upon her
continually.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah surveyed the small figure doubtfully.
&#8220;Thinkest thou the duties of the bath-chamber
would be too much for thee with older maids to
help?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam thought not, and with enthusiasm began
a week which ended all too quickly, for Milcah
resumed her old duties when the period of mourning
was past. With fine delicacy the little maid absented
herself entirely from the apartments of her
mistress, but when three days had elapsed she was
sent for.</p>

<p>Adah surveyed her with a half displeasure. &#8220;Why
dost thou not come without being commanded?
Knowest thou not that I have found thee teachable
and quick and have determined to make thee one
of my handmaidens? Already have I talked with
Milcah, and she is not displeased, nor will she keep
from thee knowledge that will be of use when thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
art older. Hear thou? She calleth thee. Thou
mayest go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older woman beamed upon her. &#8220;I see by thy
face thou hast heard. Young art thou to find such
favor in the sight of thy mistress, and much will I
have to teach thee, but that thou shouldst be chosen
for such honor doeth credit to my instruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus did it come about that Miriam became necessary
to the House of Naaman, and in gladness of
heart she began that very day to fill the place she
had won for herself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Far away the sun had begun to shine also for another
heart. A month after the Syrian raid Sarah
was still upon her bed, a little paler, a little weaker
every day. Judith had been her faithful attendant,
and so it happened that when Abner came, as he
had promised, to ask the girl at the hands of her
kinswoman, there had been no opposition. The
betrothal &#8220;feast&#8221; had been held minus the usual
festivity, the pall of melancholy having settled upon
the tiny &#8220;city&#8221; of Hannathon. Also, the principals
to this strange alliance were not popular. Lastly,
there was nothing to feast upon, the daily rations,
doled out by Abner, being barely sufficient to keep
the people alive.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, as was the custom, Judith
went to the home of her husband, whither she would
have removed Sarah but for vigorous objection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;If they should return and find the dwelling
closed&mdash;&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;Nay, but here must I
remain,&#8221; and no argument availed to change her decision.</p>

<p>Thus it had come about that Eli had gone to dwell
with Sarah in place of the son and daughter she had
lost, and Abner, upon Judith&#8217;s insistence, sent a
maid servant to care for her in Judith&#8217;s stead. Eli
was Sarah&#8217;s one stay and comfort. He treated her
precisely as he would his own mother, sustaining her
feeble strength largely by his own cheery courage
and unfailing hopefulness. Under his tender ministry
she had begun to grow stronger. The time had
come when she no longer kept to her bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must live to welcome them when they come
back,&#8221; she told him, and he turned his head to hide
a tear of pity.</p>

<p>Never did she tire of planning for the journey he
should some time take to ransom the captives, although
both clearly apprehended the difficulties first
to be overcome. &#8220;Yet will we trust in Jehovah,&#8221; he
assured her, confidently, &#8220;and he shall bring it to
pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first obstacle was removed when Abner, returning
from a short pilgrimage with seed for sowing
his fields, agreed with Eli that the latter should
work on his land for wages, the same to be collected
at harvest time. The second obstacle yielded when
Nathan, ragged and weary but rejoicing, arrived in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Hannathon. Finding that his mother&#8217;s home was
closed, he had come at once to Sarah&#8217;s, and however
doubtful his tidings it had been eagerly received:
Rachel had reached Damascus. At this very moment
she was doubtless enjoying the peace and
plenty of her kinsman&#8217;s abode. Miriam had been
well treated on the journey and had borne up
bravely. Of Benjamin he knew nothing at all and
the mother wept afresh.</p>

<p>To Eli the important thing, next after the safety
of his brother, was that he now knew the name of the
soldier in charge of the party. Isaac, once found,
could tell him the whereabouts of the captives. But
surprise was not confined to the dwelling of Sarah
nor yet to the abode of Rachel&#8217;s parents. It was also
present in the House of Abner. The master had
brought the mistress a most unexpected gift: a pearl
of great price which he had not sold for seed, as she
had supposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The grapes and olives be surety for that wherewith
I am to sow, and because thou hast been prudent
and far-seeing I return unto thee the jewel
given thee by thy father. Behold, thou hast what is
thine own, yet none but thou and I shall know, lest
it be stolen from thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith, receiving the gift with smiling thanks,
frowned when Abner had departed. Throwing the
pearl upon the floor she stamped her foot: &#8220;Thus
hath our deeds power to follow and torment us!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Thou,&#8221; addressing the jewel, &#8220;hast served thy purpose.
Why comest thou back to me like a spirit from
the sepulcher to remind and to mock, yea to be ever
unto me like a live coal in my bosom?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had been late autumn when Miriam came to
Syria; but winter rains were now over and Damascus
rejoiced in an absence of dampness and chill,
nor had the extreme heat come on with its irritating
dust. The charm of one day had not faded when
another began, but the nameless gloom which always
hovered over the House of Naaman had not
lifted, and Miriam pondered much.</p>

<p>All this time she had never seen the master of
the house, but, running across the courtyard one
morning, she met him face to face and bowed low.
She knew him by his splendid dress, his air of authority,
the deference paid him by the numerous
servants moving here and there. When he had
passed she staggered back against the wall, faint
with horror, vainly seeking to erase from memory
what she had witnessed. Now she knew why he
had not braved the inclemency of the weather heretofore.
It was leprosy!</p>

<p>Her errand forgotten, the little maid went directly
to her mistress, out of breath with haste. Impulsively
she clasped between her own the hand she
had thought so white and idle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until this moment, my mistress, did I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that thou art grieved. I thought thou wert lonely in
this big house, but I have beheld the reason for thy
sorrow. Oh, my mistress, would God that my lord
were with the prophet that is in Samaria, for he
would recover him of his leprosy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah, wife of Naaman, looked down upon the
flushed and eager figure kneeling beside her and
gently drew away her hand. She was not insensible
of the kindness intended, but it was so futile.</p>

<p>In vain Miriam told her of the miracle which had
saved Hannah&#8217;s sons from bondage and of many
another wrought by the Man of God who dwelt in
Israel, but her words fell upon an unbelieving heart.
Wonderful was it, thought Adah, to have the unquestioning
belief of youth before experience disillusions,
yet how absurd to suppose that what Rimmon
and Baal and Chemosh and a host of other gods
could not do, even though Naaman had offered rich
gifts, could be accomplished by this almost unheard
of Jehovah! Nay, it were impossible, and lest
fruitless expectation be aroused and a fresh disappointment
experienced, she would say nothing to her
husband of this well-meant but wholly impossible
suggestion.</p>

<p>It was, however, to reach Naaman&#8217;s ears a few
days later and in another manner. Miriam spoke to
Isaac about the matter and urged it with vehemence.
He could not resist her pleading, but he was reluctant,
doubtful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;Yea, I will tell him all thou sayest, but he hath
tried so many things so many times I fear he will
not heed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac was, however, mistaken. Naaman, commander-in-chief
of the armies of Syria and popular
hero, was accustomed to solicitude. To him it
seemed neither unusual nor audacious that a small
maid servant should have suggested a means of relief
from the awful malady which was slowly sapping
his strength. He paid it the compliment of a
brief consideration, wholly untouched by the hopelessness
of his wife or the hesitancy of his favorite
man servant, with both of whom he spoke concerning
it.</p>

<p>Small matter that this Jehovah whom she named
was little known and probably much less powerful
than she believed. He had long suspected&mdash;and
who would not among so many gods?&mdash;that latent
abilities sometimes resided in the most unlikely. In
favorable circumstances who could tell? Nevertheless,
it was a long journey to Israel and in his condition
a painful one. Besides, there were other
plans, suggested by people for whose judgment he
had the greatest respect, which could not be discountenanced
in favor of one so vague. Nay, he would
try remedies closer at hand.</p>

<p>Isaac bowed and withdrew, dreading the message
he must carry to Miriam. He told her with compassion
in his face, his voice, his manner, yet with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
attempt at cheerfulness which deceived neither of
them.</p>

<p>After a little she turned the head which had been
averted. &#8220;Isaac, believest thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated, then hit upon a happy expedient. &#8220;I
believe <i>thee</i>, little maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldst thou be pleased to do whatever thou
canst for me, Isaac?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a flash of amusement on the young
man&#8217;s countenance. &#8220;Knowest thou, Miriam, thou
wilt soon be a woman? Already thou art akin to
her thou shalt be.&#8221; He reached into the flowering
tree above their heads and broke off a small branch.
&#8220;Even as this beauty is the delight of our eyes, so
art thou the delight of my heart. I swear it. See, I
bind these flowers upon that heart in token of my
fealty. There shall they remain, and though they
wither, that for which they stand shall never die.
Needst thou other assurance?&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was not laughing. &#8220;Believest thou in Jehovah,
Isaac?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was I not taught so to believe, Miriam?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed. &#8220;If Eli were only here to make thee
understand! But when thou believest Jehovah as
thou believest me, then wilt thou speak to thy master
with boldness and insistence and he will hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac patted her cheeks. &#8220;I am not sure, Miriam,
but that I have known Jehovah, at least as long as
I have known thee. Be very courageous, little maid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Thy plea shall yet save thy master,&#8221; but neither
knew how long a time must first elapse, nor that this
same unselfish entreaty would some day cause international
complications.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meanwhile an event occurred which, at least
temporarily, banished the subject from Miriam&#8217;s
mind. Rachel became legally Benjamin&#8217;s wife.
With all the lavish display and elaborate ceremony
of the East they were married. That is to say, the
bridegroom walked three times around the bride ere
he lifted the detachable portion of the heavy &#8220;veil&#8221;
(really a thick garment enveloping her from head
to foot) and threw it over his shoulder as a token
that he accepted the government of this woman. In
so doing the bride&#8217;s blushing face was exposed to
the fond gaze of her husband and the curious looks
of their assembled friends.</p>

<p>Following this the guests broke into song, accompanying
themselves with timbrels, tabrets, cymbals,
and the clapping of hands. There was no
priest, no religious observance, nothing but this public
demonstration, but it was considered sufficient
and binding. The &#8220;sweet singer&#8221; now came forward.
As a matter of fact, he did not &#8220;sing&#8221; as we
understand the term, but recited in a monotonous,
sing-song voice, composing his production as he went
along. First he recounted the charms of the bride,
calling attention to her physical beauty with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
detail and fulsome praise that Rachel, with burning
cheeks, kept her eyes cast down, ashamed to look
anyone in the face. Then he told of her modesty,
her amiability, her industry, her frugality, and a
host of other virtues, real and imaginary.</p>

<p>After the bride&#8217;s personality had been dissected,
so to speak, the sweet singer turned to the bridegroom
and did the same for him, to Benjamin&#8217;s great
disgust and Isaac&#8217;s would-be-concealed amusement.
The principals having been disposed of, the indefatigable
singer turned his attention to each of the
guests in turn, reciting their eminent history and
complimenting their virtues at as great length as
the singer&#8217;s knowledge extended or his imagination
could, at a moment&#8217;s notice, supply. For a whole
week the celebration lasted. The street of the merchants
of Israel rejoiced loudly and there were flowing
wines (at Isaac&#8217;s expense) and much gluttony
and revelry.</p>

<p>The happy occasion ended with a night-time procession
through the streets of Damascus, accompanied
once more by the usual music of timbrels,
tabrets, cymbals<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the clapping of hands; the
usual lamps and torches carried by each individual
to light the dark streets and add to the festive appearance;
the usual waiting crowds to shower congratulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and good wishes upon the happy couple.
The route should have been from the home of the
bride to that of the bridegroom. In this case it was
from the abode of Amos, in a long and circuitous
march, back to it again. Miriam, sole representative
of the bridegroom&#8217;s family, at the head of the
chosen maidens, escorted Rachel to the bridal chamber.
This happened to be the guest room on the
roof, which had been decked with flowers and rendered
sweet with perfumes.</p>

<p>By this act public notice was served that the bride
had been willingly received into the heart and home
of her husband. Shortly thereafter, the bridegroom
was left at the door of the dwelling by Isaac, heading
the young men, and the public expressions of felicity
were now complete. The next day came the
leave-taking. Rebekah and her friend wept copiously.
Milcah smiled upon Rachel with the most
perfect cordiality and approval. Rachel herself and
Miriam were both very misty-eyed as they bade each
other farewell. Isaac and Benjamin held a brief
but earnest conversation in which all traces of
former misunderstandings seemed completely obliterated,
and Amos lifted his hands and voice in
blessing as the newly married pair mounted patient
asses and started alone into the hills of Syria to set
up that most important of all sanctuaries, a home.</p>

DECISION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> years went by and Miriam passed her
twelfth birthday. Thereafter she was no longer
known as &#8220;the little maid&#8221; save as a title of affection
still retained by her mistress, Milcah, and Isaac,
but referred to in terms which meant &#8220;a young
woman.&#8221; Insensibly her manners grew quieter. No
longer did she impulsively speak her mind to Adah,
nor bound unexpectedly into Milcah&#8217;s arms, nor indulge
in the old, familiar caresses where Isaac was
concerned, although she could not have explained
these changes any more than she could have given a
reason for being taller and prettier, as she was told
she was. Day by day she was becoming gently
reserved and charmingly shy and elusively sweet as
maidens are wont to be.</p>

<p>Two more years went by and spring came again,
the fourth since Miriam had come to Syria and the
third since she had first urged the visit of her master
to Israel. More and more had she become a necessary
part of the great household which had at first
been indifferent. Her time was now spent largely
in the apartments of her mistress, or in attendance
upon that lady when she overlooked the affairs of
the house or rode in her chariot. A few times had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
she visited the House of Rimmon, the sun-god of
the Syrians, but because it distressed her this was
not always required. On several occasions had she
been to the palace and, with Milcah, quite often saw
the tradespeople and helped make selections of merchandise
for her mistress.</p>

<p>Yet these years, so eventful to Miriam, had
brought little change to the House of Naaman save,
if possible, to deepen its gloom. Adah had grown
more languid, more petulant, more sad. The little
maid had not taught her how to be happy as she had
so cheerfully promised. Naaman, still demonstrating
the futility of one remedy after another,
was plainly growing worse. Each winter the rains
had washed out the roads and made traveling as
far as Israel an utter impossibility. Each spring,
when the dry season set in once more, Miriam had
entreated her mistress, appealed to Isaac and been
disappointed afresh at the rejection of her plan.
Still she hoped and grew patient.</p>

<p>Once more she pressed her query, tenderly,
anxiously, without receiving an answer. She knelt
beside her mistress, despairing, insistent. &#8220;Knowest
thou not that my lord is no better and that Jehovah
thinketh upon thy sorrow? Oh that he would
go to the prophet that is in Samaria!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caressingly Adah took Miriam&#8217;s face between her
hands and looked at her through tear-blurred eyes.
&#8220;All that I possess would I give, little maid, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
confidence of youth, but even as the ruthless rains
wash away the footpaths, so doth Experience, in the
autumn and winter of life, steal away courage and
joy. Yea, well I know that thy master&#8217;s malady
groweth worse, but what availeth a long and painful
journey with disappointment at its end?&#8221;</p>

<p>Finding that neither argument nor persuasion
availed, Miriam abandoned the subject and waited
until she should be able to see Isaac. The next day
she was fortunate in having speech with him just
before he was summoned to his master&#8217;s apartments.
Briefly she outlined the last conversation with her
mistress and its hopelessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But because thou dwellest in his favor, Isaac,
speak thou unto him yet again that he perish not. Believest
thou that Jehovah can do this? Believest
thou, Isaac?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; looking into the serious depths of her dark
eyes, &#8220;yea, Miriam, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time was auspicious. The burden of discomfort
which Naaman had borne so long had become
irritating, loathsome, intolerable. If, by enduring
a little more, he could end it forever&mdash;yea,
he would take the journey to Israel. It was a forlorn
hope, but he would risk it.</p>

<p>Breathless with haste, Isaac paused a brief instant
before Miriam. He chose to be very mysterious.
&#8220;What wouldst thou, little maid, if thou couldst
have thy choice?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Expectantly she searched his radiant countenance
and caught the gayety of his mood. &#8220;Not fruit nor
flowers; not silken garments, nor fine linen, nor
choice food, for thus sumptuously do I fare every
day. Not even a new timbrel, for that thou didst
give me when I was but a <i>little</i> maid is beautiful
with ivory and mother-of-pearl. Naught have I to
wish for save that my master should seek Jehovah
through the Man of God who dwelleth at Samaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then thou hast thy desire. He goeth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; she asked, excitedly.</p>

<p>The soldier shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Our master&#8217;s
impatience brooketh no delay, as thou wilt
know from knowing him, but he must first obtain
the king&#8217;s permission and the king&#8217;s credentials ere
he dare venture into another kingdom to ask a
favor of a monarch with whose house Syria hath
been time and again at war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was dismayed, incredulous. It had seemed
such a simple matter to her.</p>

<p>Isaac smiled. &#8220;Thou dost not consider how great
a man is our master. Knowest thou not it is an affair
of state?&#8221;</p>

<p>He left her and she ran with swift footsteps to
tell the glad news to Milcah and then, with greater
deliberation, to speak of it to her mistress.</p>

<p>Next morning the household was early astir. The
general air of excitement precluded sleep to even
the most laggard, yet why this straw of relief appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
more able to bear the weight of their longings
than previous efforts no one could have told, nor,
indeed, did they pause to ask. None, at least, save
Miriam. At the top of the stone staircase which
led to the roof she unexpectedly met Isaac. He
greeted her gayly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is well, little maid, so far. To-day I go to
the palace to request an audience for my master
with the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thinkest thou, Isaac, that he will approve the
journey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thoughts of a king, Miriam, are past finding
out, but we have a good omen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the opal sky, beautiful in its sunrise
tints. &#8220;Seest thou? As the Syrians say, our all-conquering
lord, the Sun, goeth forth from his
habitation with smiles to the arms of the virgin East
who haileth his approach with blushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam pointed to the distant mountains. &#8220;Seest
thou the good omen? No haze shrouds them from
our view, but even as they stand immovable and protecting,
so Jehovah is ever a shield round about his
people. The rosy sky, against which the mountains
show dark and clear, reminds us that our hope is in
the Lord our God who only giveth us the victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier stood abashed, but in his eyes there
dawned a something which was akin to reverence
and more. The girl, catching the look quite accidentally,
flushed as prettily as the sky they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
watching and fled instinctively, even as she wondered
why she did these things. Yet she did not seek
explanations of anyone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With armament resplendent and an obsequious
group of soldier-attendants, as befitted the importance
of the mission, Isaac was dispatched to the
palace. Having passed the gatekeeper and been
conducted across two or three courtyards to the entrance
of the king&#8217;s residence proper, the guard suddenly
stood at attention while Isaac found himself
in the presence of the chief officer of the palace.</p>

<p>Each bowed to the ground, exclaiming, &#8220;Peace be
unto thee.&#8221; Three times this was repeated.</p>

<p>Each then put his hand to his heart, which was
meant to say, &#8220;My heart meditates upon thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each next put his hands to his lips as if to say,
&#8220;My lips speak well of thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, each put his hand to his forehead, which
conveyed the flattering intelligence, &#8220;My intellect delights
in thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lastly they fell upon each other&#8217;s neck and embraced
fervently.</p>

<p>These civilities over, they stooped and rested in
the comfortable Oriental fashion while they held
converse. My lord high officer inquired for his
visitor&#8217;s grandfather. Instead of replying truthfully
that he was long since dead, diplomacy required that
Isaac relate a tale of courage and honor, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
true or untrue, which he ascribed to the <i>other&#8217;s</i>
grandfather.</p>

<p>Well pleased with the compliment, my lord high
officer inquired for Isaac&#8217;s father, with the same result.
Next, my lord high officer inquired for Isaac&#8217;s
master and attributed to him deeds of valor which
Isaac entirely disclaimed for Naaman, pronouncing
blessings upon the other&#8217;s master, the king.</p>

<p>By degrees and after a considerable time had
elapsed, the moment was opportune for the delivery
of Isaac&#8217;s message. He had come to request an audience
of King Ben-hadad for his master, Naaman.
My lord high officer was politely kind. He would
see that the message was conveyed to his master,
the king, and in the course of a few days an answer
would be returned. Although his real errand was
now completed, Isaac&#8217;s manner was casual and betrayed
no haste, after the approved style of Eastern
courtiers. For quite awhile longer they chatted with
gravity and pretended interest, then they rose, bidding
each other farewell with the same elaborate gestures
which had marked their meeting.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief and a complacence born of
duty well performed, Isaac and his soldiers took their
way homeward and the House of Naaman began
that waiting program which was to be its chief occupation
for some time to come and of which its master
was to grow almost fatally weary before it
should be brought to a happy ending. In a few days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
as promised by my lord high officer, the watchman
stationed upon Naaman&#8217;s roof to note the approach
of the king&#8217;s messenger sent the joyful cry echoing
through the courtyards: &#8220;Behold, he cometh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the great house responded with a bustle
of preparation and a suspension of all unnecessary
tasks, giving itself up to the delightful thrill of expectancy.
The crowd of mendicants, the halt and
maimed and blind, pensioners upon Naaman&#8217;s
bounty, melted away from before his gate&mdash;at the
command of the gatekeeper, aided by a stout staff
and one or two men servants&mdash;like snow before the
sun. The courtyards were cleared of all save those
whose privilege and duty it was to be there. Isaac,
not now in the dress of a soldier but in the soft, fine
raiment of a rich man, as befitted the master he
represented, met the stranger at the very gateway.</p>

<p>By means of those elaborate bows which had characterized
Isaac&#8217;s previous visit to the palace, the
messenger was finally drawn within the greater privacy
of one of the inner courts. This not only shut
them out from the gaze and hearing of the curious
but conveyed the complimentary impression that he
was received into the bosom of the family. His
message was brief. On the morrow his master, the
king, would give audience to his well-beloved servant,
Naaman, at the fourth hour of the day. Yet, however
concise the communication, Oriental etiquette
forbade its delivery in a hasty manner or without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
due ceremony. A long time was it before Isaac,
bidding farewell to this important guest, was at liberty
to pay a scarcely less ceremonious visit to his
anxious master and to stand at length, smiling, before
Miriam, that she might hear the joyful tidings.</p>

<p>The next day, promptly at ten o&#8217;clock, Naaman
and his imposing bodyguard of soldiers appeared at
the palace. A no less imposing retinue of palace
officials and servants, led by my lord high officer,
met him at the palace gate and with great apparent
respect conducted him to the throne room. Here
he and his king exchanged the same elaborate courtesies
which had marked the meeting of their representatives
a few days before. Yet with a difference!
The latter had been coldly formal, meaninglessly
polite. This was the greeting of friends, of
those whose regard for each other was built upon a
solid foundation of respect and affection, although
there was not the slightest trace of undue familiarity
on the one hand nor lack of dignity on the other.</p>

<p>Salutations concluded, the king commanded all
who attended him to retire from the immediate vicinity.
Naaman, following suit, gestured to Isaac,
and his bodyguard likewise withdrew to a distance.
The two highest dignitaries of Syria could now converse
in such privacy that their tones alone were
audible to those who stood at either end of the long
throne room. Impressively yet briefly Naaman recited
the facts: it had become known to him, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
a maid in his household, that there dwelt in the city
of Samaria, in the Land of Israel, a prophet of Jehovah,
the little-known God of the land. This seer,
it appeared, was a man mighty in word and deed,
able, so the maiden stated, to heal even the dread
disease of leprosy. Now, therefore, if he had found
favor in the sight of his master, the king, he hoped
it would please the king to allow his servant to depart
in peace upon this mission.</p>

<p>Ben-hadad was gracious. The affliction of Naaman,
the man whom all Syria delighted to honor,
was also his affliction. Any chance of relief, however
remote, must be seized with as little delay as
possible. If Jehovah, the God of the Israelites, acting
through his prophet, was thus powerful, to effect
a cure would be but a small matter and one to
be quickly accomplished. He, the king of Syria,
would write a letter to the young king of Israel, son
of their late enemy, Ahab, which letter should be
delivered in person by Naaman. The request therein
contained would of course be immediately granted.
The affair should take precedence of certain other
state business so that, in a few days, the letter should
be written and dispatched by messenger to the House
of Naaman.</p>

<p>Thus comforted and highly elated at the success of
his mission, Naaman and his attendants made the
usual elaborate adieux and departed. It was not
that an interview between the king and his army&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
commander-in-chief was either unusual or infrequent,
but this had been fraught with national and
international consequence, and ceremony was necessary.
Not often did one monarch ask a favor of
another without intending to reciprocate, but this
visit of Naaman to Israel, with its consequent exchange
of diplomatic courtesies, meant a closer alliance
of the two nations; a declaration of friendship,
as it were, which would last as long as it served their
purpose and which might not be a bad thing in these
days of Assyrian encroachments.</p>

<p>Miriam, watching the approach of the party from
her favorite spot on the roof, observed that the
leader lifted his shield of beaten brass and pointed
to the distant mountains. She understood. Isaac
was telling her that Jehovah, in whom she trusted,
had brought it to pass: the king&#8217;s answer was favorable,
and breathlessly she ran to carry the second
message of hope to her mistress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


CONSTERNATION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> that portion of the veranda where stood Isaac
and Miriam, eagerly discussing recent events, there
was much passing to and fro of men servants and
maid servants, picking up crumbs of talk like hungry
birds at a feast. With an imperious gesture, borrowed
from his master, Isaac made known his displeasure.
Instantly each individual had duties elsewhere.</p>

<p>Miriam laughed. &#8220;What a great man thou art becoming,
Isaac!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but if this mission of our
master to Israel be prospered, then must we flatter
and defer to thee, for thy position in the household
will be enviable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately regretting the contamination of her
mind with any taint of worldly wisdom, he ignored
her surprised exclamations and spoke of the rich
stores which were being gathered in preparation for
the journey to Israel, a thank-offering to the prophet
should Naaman be healed. Much gold and silver,
not in coins&mdash;which came at a later period&mdash;but in
bulk, ready to be cut and weighed according to the
amount required when occasion arose for paying
or giving, and, in addition, the famous products of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Damascus looms and other Eastern merchandise:
silk that would neither wrinkle nor cut; cotton and
linen of exquisite weave, and heavier fabrics, all
made up into the much-prized &#8220;changes of raiment,&#8221;
which would last the fortunate possessor a lifetime
and still not be worn out.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Miriam asked a half-indignant question:
&#8220;Thinkest thou the Man of God will regard this?
Nay, but only that our master may know Jehovah
liveth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac looked at her strangely. &#8220;It is customary,
when asking a favor, to take in thine hand a present,
and I have never known a prophet who would
refuse it. Have we not tried many prophets and
many gods? Besides, is not our master very rich
and Damascus the gateway between Assyria on the
east and Egypt on the west, a city great in commerce
and industry? Yea, these things are but
right.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had been a late spring. That is to say, the dry
season had been late in arriving, and for diplomatic
and business reasons Naaman&#8217;s journey to Israel
was not commenced until nearly midsummer, but
the great day came at last. Miriam, her cheeks glowing
with excitement, watched it from the latticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
window where she could stand now on fewer cushions
than formerly. It was an imposing procession.
Isaac, at the head, looking very splendid, Miriam
thought, waved her a farewell as they went past the
lattice. He could not see her, but he knew she was
there.</p>

<p>She gazed eagerly, noting every detail. After
Isaac came his servant, carrying a long pole on the
end of which was a brazier of coals, the smoke of
which would be a cloud by day and a fire by night,
thus guiding the drivers behind no matter how far
they straggled apart. A bodyguard of horsemen
entirely surrounded the chariot, in which was Naaman,
with one driver and one attendant, the latter
supporting a sort of awning on poles to protect his
master from sun and wind as he traveled. A second
chariot followed in case of accident to the first. At
the rear of the bodyguard rode a man whom Miriam
had long ago learned to distrust, Lemuel by name.
At a little distance followed the camel train with its
precious burden of merchandise and another soldier-guard.
Another space and then the asses, laden with
food, water, camping equipment, and the various
necessities of such a lengthy journey. Last of all
came a few asses and camels led, these to be used in
case of emergency. A few more soldiers completed
the cavalcade.</p>

<p>It was impressive, picturesque, noisy, with gaudily
dressed drivers, the decorated animals with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
tinkling bells, the cries in many languages of those
who urged them forward, to say nothing of the more
ordinary sight, the soldiers in dress-uniforms, dazzlingly
bright, with the sun reflected on metal helmets
and shields and scalelike coats of mail. No
wonder Damascus paused in its business and pleasure
to admire and applaud as the party filed slowly and
with dignity through its streets and out of the southwestern
gate. No wonder Miriam was excited, entranced,
delighted. In her wildest dreams she had
not beheld it thus, but after it had passed there came
a feeling of desolation such as she had not experienced
since that first terrible night in Damascus.
Almost an hour later Milcah found her, huddled
among the cushions, moaning and weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have gone; gone to Israel; and I am left
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Astonished but not unsympathetic, Milcah attempted
comfort, but the writhing, disheveled figure
and the wild sobs frightened her. Running excitedly
to her mistress, she succeeded in startling that
lady out of her accustomed languor and a few moments
later they both bent over Miriam with deep
concern. Adah gathered the girl in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desirest thou to go to Israel, little maid? Thou
dost, thou sayest? Thou art grieving for thy father
and mother and thy home there? Nay, do not weep.
Thou shalt go. Only be thou patient until we learn
how it is with thy master.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Gradually, under these assurances and Milcah&#8217;s
ministrations, Miriam became calmer. Wearied by
her outburst and half ashamed, she was persuaded
to rest in a darkened room until she should feel quite
herself again. To her own surprise, she found she
was strangely weak and unnerved. For days she
could not rise, and then she dragged about the great
house, pale and dispirited, until the excitement of
watching for the return of the party brought a little
color to her cheeks and a little hope to her heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Naaman and his company proceeded
on their long, long way in the scorching heat. Unerringly
Isaac led his party out from the cool shade
of the orchards surrounding the city of Damascus;
by broad, rocky terraces to the wind-swept Plain of
the Hauran, toward Mount Hermon&#8217;s rugged dominance
in the south. Past wheat-fields and pasture
lands, a few insignificant water courses and occasional
small groves of trees. Over the plains they
went, across the Jordan and up the broad and fertile
Vale of Jezreel, brown in the midsummer heat and
drought. A twist in the valley and they were in the
basin in which Samaria was situated. Up, up, three
hundred feet or more to the very top of the cone-shaped
hill upon which sat the city itself, impregnable,
beautiful, commanding a wide view of the
Valley of Jezreel at its feet and the blue waters of
the Great Sea (now called the Mediterranean) only
twenty-three miles distant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The approach of so large a procession could not
remain unknown. Long, long before it wound its
slow way up the hill, among the gardens and scattered
houses of the suburbs, the watchman in the
tower had noted its strength and its probable importance
and hastily communicated this intelligence
to the proper officials, who had, in turn, sent a message
to the palace. Long, long before it entered the
square chamber of masonry which in the Orient they
call a gate, prepared to emerge therefrom into the
city through the opening in another wall, the elders
or judges sitting on the stone benches ranged along
the two blank walls were ready with questions. Was
their errand one of peace? Who were they and
whence did they come? What was the purpose of
this visit to their city and whom sought they?</p>

<p>Isaac&#8217;s duties multiplied. He was now not only
guide but interpreter and the trusted servant who
should present his master&#8217;s all-important plea to the
city officials. More than this, he was the courteous
diplomat who must secure the favor and the good
will of these officials who would, at their discretion,
give them safe conduct to the king. The examination
into their credentials was conducted with great
solemnity and consumed a vast deal of time, but
with the happy result that the procession of foreign
guests was conducted with much ceremony through
the crooked streets of Samaria to the celebrated
Ivory Palace of the king; those streets so narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
that two camels could not go abreast and leave room
for foot passengers, so shaded from the heat of the
sun by the windowless buildings on either side that,
had it been more unusual, it would have been depressing.</p>

<p>In the East there is courtesy but no haste. One
wing of the palace, with its own courts, was set
aside for the use of the visitors, and trusted servants
and high officials busied themselves in making
these accommodations comfortable for those who
honored the roof by their presence. Isaac was
granted a formal interview with the chief officer of
the palace, the occasion being much the same as in
Syria, when he had appeared to request audience
for his master with King Ben-hadad. Now as then
an interval must elapse while the message was conveyed
to King Jehoram and he returned an answer,
but in consideration of the distinguished position
which Naaman occupied in his own country and
the compliment which his visit implied, this was considerably
hurried.</p>

<p>The next day Isaac, chief servant of the embassy,
received a call from the chief officer of the palace,
appointing the hour and day when King Jehoram
would receive in person the letter of King Ben-hadad
and the officer whom it introduced. Naaman,
tired from the long and exhausting journey, was
glad to have a few hours of rest, but as the hardened
soldier recovered somewhat from his pain and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
fatigue, he grew impatient for the interview. The
hour came. Amid great splendor Naaman was conducted
into the presence of the young King Jehoram,
the letter was presented, courteous greetings and assurances
of friendship were exchanged, and then
Naaman was escorted back to his apartments to
await the real answer to his plea; the favorable reply
anticipated but not yet given! Though compatible
with Eastern custom, it was a situation calculated
to inspire distrust in the breast of the suffering
Naaman and uneasiness on the part of his
servant, Isaac.</p>

<p>In that portion of the palace they had just left the
air was charged with excitement. The king, surrounded
by his counselors, old and young, rent his
garments with true Oriental display of grief and
vexation. What power had he to cure a man of
leprosy? Was he a god to kill and make alive? No
reasonable human being would suppose he could do
this thing. Nay, it was merely a pretext for Syria
to declare war against Israel. Not content with
petty raids on their fertile valleys almost every year;
not satisfied with carrying off their flocks, their
grain, their wine and their oil, and even a captive
now and then; not content that Jehoram&#8217;s father,
Ahab, had spared Ben-hadad&#8217;s life when the latter
was at his mercy, and made a treaty of trade and
peace when he might have been less generous; not
satisfied with this and all of these, Ben-hadad now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
without just cause, sought an open rupture. And
Israel&mdash;was Israel prepared to resist an invasion?
Nay, but as the ravenous dogs fell upon travelers in
the night so would Syria fall upon them and rend
them in pieces!</p>

<p>The counselors of the young king shook their
heads and mingled their tears with his, their hearts
heavy with sorrow. If this thing came upon them&mdash;and
it had&mdash;they must meet it like men. What did
prudence dictate? It was a long conference, prudence
seeming to dictate quite a number of things.
As a result, the king hastily sent from one end of
his kingdom to the other, taking account of his resources:
the number of his fighting men; his
weapons of war; his food-supplies; his gold and silver.
His counselors met in secret session again and
considered Israel&#8217;s trade relations, her diplomatic
friendships. Was she able, alone, to meet the enemy?
Would she have help? Upon what could she depend
when this unfavorable answer should be returned
as soon, indeed, it must be?</p>

<p>Despite the urgency of the occasion, this census
consumed some time and was, alas, in no wise satisfactory.
It was a fact, grave but unmistakable, that
Israel was not prepared to meet a foe of Syria&#8217;s
means, of Syria&#8217;s army, of Syria&#8217;s leadership! Israel
never faced a greater crisis. Her king was commanded
to do the impossible or else&mdash;there were no
need to complete the sentence. The veriest child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
could speak the answer and dread it, and King Jehoram
lifted up his voice and wept in the demonstrative
Eastern fashion. Consternation, though
veiled, was not confined to the palace. The arrival
of so large a procession, its gorgeous display of
wealth, the foreign garb of its people and their
probable errand could not fail to be a matter of public
interest and conjecture. The hopelessness of its
mission could not long be kept from the populace,
nor fail to sound a note of dismay to the thoughtful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the apartments paneled in ivory,
among the simple but costly furnishings, Naaman
paced restlessly. Was this prophet of Jehovah on
a journey to some far country that he came not?
Was there any deception on the part of this young
king that he failed to return a favorable reply? Did
he consider it a matter of so little importance that
he could safely procrastinate? Could there have
been any mistake in the information which had sent
him hither? Down, far below, into the Valley of
Jezreel Naaman looked, but the yellow grain fields
merely nodded in the summer heat and refused to answer.
Off to the blue strip of the Great Sea he raised
his eyes, but the flashing oars of the Ph&#339;nician
galleys rose and fell unheeding. Toward the hills
he looked, but from their bare, brown hulks no help
arose and Hermon regarded him coldly from its
snow-crowned peak. Weary, puzzled and in pain,
Naaman strove, sighing, to wait yet another day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
while the little maid whose cheerful assurances had
been the cause of his visit, lay upon her bed, in the
grasp of a great longing, knowing not that her unselfish
plea had brought about international complications
and deep consternation to her beloved Land
of Israel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


HOPE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a crooked and somewhat retired street of Samaria
stood a house which, next to the Ivory Palace
of the king, was the most noted in all Israel. On
the outside there was nothing to denote any special
importance, nothing to particularly commend it to
the attention of the young man who walked along
slowly, scanning each dwelling with interest. It
might have been the home of any well-to-do citizen.
The stranger paused doubtfully, asked a question of
a passer-by, and then approached the entrance gate,
rapping loudly.</p>

<p>One in the garb of a servant but with the air and
manner of authority responded to the summons.
That is to say, although not opening the portal he
called through it to know who was there and what
the errand. These questions being answered satisfactorily,
the stranger was allowed to remain standing
without until the servant within walked leisurely
across the courtyard and ascended a flight of stone
steps in the corner to the flat roof of the dwelling
and so into the presence of an older man, to whom
he bowed low and who, in return, greeted him eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;No message hath come to me from the king,
Gehazi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, my master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what saith the people to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Despair filleth all hearts, my lord, and the king
rendeth his garments and weepeth, for there be none
to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of the older man suddenly became gray
and drawn and he went on talking, but as if to himself:
&#8220;Neither king nor people remember that Jehovah
is their refuge, a very present help in trouble.
Yet will not the son of Jezebel hearken nor the
people whose minds the priests of Baal hath darkened.&#8221;
He stood silent a moment, then stretched out
his arms over the parapet, toward the panoramic
view of the city and valley below.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Israel, that ye would consider and know that
the Lord is good and that thy strength cometh from
him, whose servant I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>His head sank upon his breast in meditation, but
ere long he roused himself and spoke with decision:
&#8220;We have waited many days, Gehazi. Now shall
they see the salvation of the Lord of Hosts. Do
thou send to the palace and say to the young King
Jehoram, &#8216;Wherefore hast thou rent thy garments?
Let this man, Naaman, come now to me and he shall
know that there is a God in Israel and I, his
prophet.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gehazi again bowed low, murmuring some words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of assent, after which he remembered to speak of
the visitor below.</p>

<p>&#8220;A stranger, my master, is without the gate, desiring
to talk with the seer. He giveth his name as
Isaac of Damascus, a soldier. Shall I bid him enter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowest thou his voice, Gehazi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my master, but it hath the ring of sincerity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then shall he be admitted. Doubtless he cometh
with this Syrian, Naaman, and seeketh me to inquire
of the Lord concerning him. I await him
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gehazi leisurely descended the stairs, crossed the
courtyard, opened the gate and received the visitor
within. Isaac&#8217;s sandals having been left outside,
Gehazi brought forth a basin over which the
young man held first his hands and then his feet
while the servant, from the ewer which he held,
poured water over them. Isaac then wiped off the
water with the towel which hung from the other&#8217;s
girdle.</p>

<p>Gehazi now disappeared and a moment later set
before the stranger a little bread and wine. This
was partaken of with the audible satisfaction which
Eastern etiquette demanded&mdash;the smacking of lips
which told of the pleasure conferred by this attention.</p>

<p>These ceremonies over, the visitor was conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to the roof, where the host awaited him. Gehazi
bowed low before his master: &#8220;It is Isaac, a soldier
of Damascus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man forsook his meditation and looked
toward his guest. In the meanwhile, he of whom
they spoke, apparently seeing nothing at all had yet
seen everything. No detail of his surroundings had
escaped his observant eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I like not the master better than the man,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;then shall I know that the little maid
hath been indeed mistaken in putting confidence
here,&#8221; and he sighed.</p>

<p>Noting that he was expected to approach, Isaac
ran forward, prostrating himself. Rising, he reverentially
took between his hands the face of the seer
and kissed his head. Immediately the older man
extended his hand, which the visitor clasped, and
each kissed the back of the other&#8217;s hand. Isaac&#8217;s
greeting was the tribute of an inferior to a revered
superior. Elisha&#8217;s extended hand was a condescension
which the younger man understood as placing
him on the footing of an equal or that of an honored
guest, yet courtesy forbade him to speak until
his host had first taken the initiative.</p>

<p>The keen gaze of the latter seemed to penetrate
his gorgeous costume and lay bare every secret of
his soul, but the voice was kindly: &#8220;What is thy
need, my son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art Elisha, prophet of Jehovah?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;Yea, my son. What wouldst thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>What would he? Isaac&#8217;s voice fairly trembled
with the earnestness of his desire, and he spoke rapidly:
&#8220;That thou wouldst heal my master, Naaman
the Syrian.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prophet sighed. &#8220;Neither king nor people
have asked this thing at the hand of the Lord. Great
love hast thou for thy master that thou comest to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love and gratitude and admiration and pity, my
lord. All these have I for my great and good master,
Naaman, but I have come to thee more in dread
of sorrow to a little maid whom I carried away captive
almost five years ago and who hath brought to
mind the teaching of my mother, who was of the
Land of Gilead. Thou must know, oh my father,
that among so many gods it is hard to know the one
supreme save as now and again one performeth
some mighty work which causeth men to say, &#8216;Lo
here,&#8217; or &#8216;Lo there,&#8217; but my mother and this little
maid have ever maintained that Jehovah is God
alone, who only doeth marvelous works. If this be
so, thou his prophet canst heal my master of his
leprosy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Straight into the troubled eyes of his young visitor
the older man looked and smiled. &#8220;It is well, my
son. To win the unselfish affection of a child; to
love a maid purely and protectingly and to keep thyself
worthy of both will be to thy remorseful soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
as waters of cleansing.&#8221; Then, sternly: &#8220;And to
atone for the evil thou hast wrought to the House
of Caleb, I charge thee to do this thing lest the wrath
of Jehovah fall upon thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Awed and assenting, Isaac stood through a few
moments of silence on the part of his host. At last
the latter turned to him. &#8220;As to thy master, Naaman,
behold, before thy return to the palace, he will
have received a message from the king to present
himself to me. To-morrow at this hour thou shalt
bring him hither and both he and thou shalt know
the only true God.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker made a gesture by which his visitor
understood that the interview was ended. With
respectful ceremony Isaac made his adieux and
started back to the Ivory Palace, back to his impatient
master. As he went he reviewed the events of
the past few weeks, the disquieting rumors which
his familiarity with the language had enabled him
to hear in the long walks he had taken through the
city with a view to news-gathering, a pastime inspired
by Jehoram&#8217;s delay and Naaman&#8217;s depression.
It was this which had driven him to the prophet. He
must know for himself if there were hope.</p>

<p>At the palace gate there awaited him a servant
whom they had brought from Syria to say that his
master desired his presence without delay. Isaac
presented himself humbly, half expecting the wrath
which he encountered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;So thine own business and pleasure are more to
thee than mine, Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my master, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The king&#8217;s messenger hath been here and thou
away. None but Lemuel to speak his tongue and he
haltingly and the message one of importance. Yet
peradventure I should not have expected thy interest.
Thinkest thou I have not marked thy many
absences of late and this the longest of all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my master, if thou hadst followed me&mdash;&#8221;
The eager tone trailed off into silence. How could
he relate the disheartening tidings he had heard on
every hand when it could but add to his master&#8217;s
impatience and perhaps frustrate the very purpose
for which they had come? The pause was lengthy.</p>

<p>Naaman&#8217;s manner changed from sarcastic irritability
to amused toleration. &#8220;I had forgotten,
Isaac, how oft thou hast been in this land. I should
have remembered thy youth and thy good looks and
the charm of the maids of Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, my master. I but went&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman waved aside the explanation. &#8220;Few
maidens are unwilling to smile upon a soldier, but
it mattereth not,&#8221; he said with finality. &#8220;I should
not expect from thee the wisdom of age. I do not
expect it. But go now and make what preparations
are necessary, for to-morrow, at the fourth hour, we
present ourselves before this prophet of Jehovah for
my healing. The mouth of the king hath spoken it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Other mouths, both within and without the palace,
took up the words and repeated them until, between
excitement and curiosity, Samaria slept badly that
night. The next morning, at the hour appointed,
the narrow streets of the city were packed with humanity
as the Syrian embassy wended its slow and
stately way to the house of the Man of God.</p>

<p>In front rode several dignitaries in chariots representing
King Jehoram. Next came Isaac on horseback,
attended by his servant and a soldier or two
who preceded the chariot of Naaman. The Syrian
bodyguard, who followed, were escorted by the
flower of the Israelitish army. In the rear came the
pack-animals, their picturesque drivers, and a few
more soldiers. It was a civil and not a military procession,
and the splendor and dignity of both countries
were represented. Amid gaping crowds the
company came to a halt before the House of Elisha.
Slowly and as if in expectation of their arrival, the
gate opened. The moment was tense with expectancy.
As a mark of respect to the prophet all
dismounted, including Naaman, but it was not
Elisha. It was his servant, Gehazi, with a message:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus saith the Man of God: &#8216;Go wash in the
Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again
to thee and thou shalt be clean.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon Naaman, who flushed
crimson with rage and disappointment. The Jordan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
indeed! The muddy, swift-flowing, treacherous
Jordan! Contrast it with the clear, sparkling waters
of the Abana and Pharpar back in Syria! If all he
needed was to dip in some river, he much preferred
those at home. They were, at least, less repulsive
than this boasted stream in a foreign land. Were
they not better than all the rivers of Israel? And
the idea of sending a servant with the message!
Why did not the prophet himself come out, and
stand, and call upon the name of his God in the
spectacular manner of the East? Why did he not
strike his hand over the diseased flesh and effect a
cure with all the ceremony it was natural to expect?
The meanest servant could have hoped for nothing
less than such treatment as he, Naaman, had received.
To put the most charitable construction
upon the act, the prophet had evidently not understood
the position held by his visitor, else he would
have acted more in accordance with the customs of
the day. Nevertheless he, Naaman, had not come
all the way to Israel to be treated discourteously,
slightingly; to be mocked and ridiculed. The long
and painful journey had been worse than useless.
They would return whence they had come and woe
to Israel when Ben-hadad heard!</p>

<p>The Syrian embassy whispered among themselves.
The elders of the city and the dignitaries from the
palace held a brief parley and then approached Naaman
with an air of dismayed humility, with apology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and almost with entreaty, but the outraged visitor
was conscious only of the insult put upon him. In
the face of his anger all of Isaac&#8217;s diplomacy served
only to ruffle his feelings the more and to make the
efforts of the young interpreter and servant appear
ridiculous in the eyes of those who saw the futility
of anything but surrender to the exasperating circumstances.
The king&#8217;s representatives were thoroughly
alarmed. In a few days, perhaps, when the
wrath of their mighty visitor had cooled, he might
be persuaded to try the remedy, which appeared even
to them as questionable, if not absurd. If he did
not care to be reasonable, or if the prescription
failed, then, indeed, the last state of this miserable
affair would be worse than the first. Years ago King
Ahab had had Ben-hadad at his mercy; Israel had
put her foot upon Syria&#8217;s neck, but since then other
wars had changed entirely the complexion of Eastern
politics.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It was a crestfallen party which took its slow departure
from the prophet&#8217;s house. Even the horses
seemed to feel the general air of gloom and walked
less proudly. Isaac, chagrined at this unexpected
turn of affairs, heard not the comments of his companions,
saw not the jostling and awe-struck
throngs, cared not for his master&#8217;s ire. He was
conscious only that back in Syria was a maid with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the light of happy expectancy in her eyes and it
must not be dimmed! He resolved it fiercely, striving
to consider the situation as calmly as possible.
For Miriam&#8217;s sake, considerations of self were obliterated.
Into the struggle he threw his all, risking
his future and the favor of his impulsive master. At
a turn into the wider street which led to the palace,
Naaman, with uncooled wrath, commanded greater
speed, but Isaac, turning, wheeled his horse directly
in the path of the chariot, thus halting the entire
company.</p>

<p>The anger in his master&#8217;s eye was like a drawn
sword, but love for Miriam was like a shield, warding
off the thrusts. His voice slightly trembled but
he held his ground: &#8220;My father, if the prophet had
bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have
done it? How much rather when he saith to thee,
&#8216;Wash and be clean&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman, the bluff man of moods, at first irritated
at such daring, gradually became aware that he admired
it. He himself had experienced great moments
and high courage. And there was no selfishness
in the plea. Isaac was asking for nothing which
could benefit him personally. Naaman looked at
the straight, young figure, at the earnest face, at the
yearning affection in the eyes. &#8220;My father,&#8221; he had
said. Naaman felt the charm of deference from
youth to age; the tribute of regard from man to
master; the acknowledgment of respect from an inferior.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
&#8220;If the prophet had bid thee do some great
thing, wouldst thou not have done it?&#8221; He would.
He was keyed up to any effort. That was wherein
lay the disappointment. &#8220;How much rather when
he saith to thee, &#8216;Wash and be clean&#8217;?&#8221; The logic
appealed to Naaman&#8217;s sense of justice. Why not
indeed? It could but fail as had everything else.
Why take all this trouble and then refuse to do the
thing recommended?</p>

<p>The king&#8217;s representatives looked on in amazement.
Who and what was this youthful interpreter
and courtier that he dared speak words of remonstrance
and exhortation to this powerful foreigner?
That he was doing just this was evident even though
the language used left the exact sentences in doubt.
The Syrian soldiery held its breath in wonder, uncertain
whether to admire Isaac&#8217;s bravery or condemn
his temerity. They would decide according
to the outcome. Naaman&#8217;s expression passed
through a series of changes and took on the cool
matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;On,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;on&mdash;to the Jordan!&#8221;</p>

REWARDS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the city of Samaria to the banks of the Jordan
was some thirty-five miles, considerably more
than a day&#8217;s journey each way. It lacked an hour
of noon when they started, so Naaman&#8217;s party was
obliged to encamp over night, and it was late the
following afternoon when they finally reached their
destination. With an eagerness that knew no faltering,
no uncertainty, Isaac had led the way. Now,
finding a shallow spot in the turbulent river near
one of the fords, a spot warmed for hours by the
summer sun, Naaman had dipped seven times, as
directed, the seventh turning vague hope into joyous
certainty. He was healed every whit! Joy knew
no bounds. The king&#8217;s representatives had embraced
him and each other. Israel was saved! The
Syrian embassy was scarcely less contained. Even
the camel drivers from the desert and the lowest of
the servants shouted with loud voices and great
enthusiasm and Naaman beamed upon them all, but
it was Isaac to whom his first words of relief and
happiness had been addressed, and Isaac upon whom
he smiled with tenderness and even affection.</p>

<p>With hearts attuned to see the wonderful yellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and browns of the Valley of Jezreel in late summer,
their horses&#8217; hoofs had again pattered its long expanse,
the laden camels and asses driven in the rear.
One more night they had encamped and now they
came straggling up the hill they had descended three
days before. But the young leader had made a
slight error in judgment as to the time of arrival.
It was shortly after sunset, a few minutes past the
hour when the city closed its gates&mdash;and no man
came to open! Lemuel, companion of Isaac&#8217;s old
scouting days, approached him with a respect so
profound that its insincerity was patent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, there be not room among this crowd of
mendicants,&#8221; glancing contemptuously at other belated
travelers, &#8220;to spread our camping equipment
with due regard to our importance, and without it
we shall find the night dews too heavy to be pleasant.
I pray thee have the gates opened without delay that
thy servants may render thee the honor due so great
a captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annoyed, Isaac ceased thundering at the gates
and became aware of the murmuring among his own
party and the derision of the merchants and others
who, like themselves, seemed doomed to spend the
night with only the city walls for a covering while
the chill air of the mountains penetrated even the
thickest of garments. The voice of Naaman commanded
silence. He spoke compassionately to
Isaac.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;My son, he at whom the multitude throws roses
feels mostly the thorns. He who by any act becomes
more noticeable than his fellows is the target
for their envy. Only a brave man can afford to
be prominent. Do I not know, I, the veteran of
a hundred wars and judged of all? Courage in
the peril of battle I know thou hast, Isaac, for
with mine own eyes have I beheld, but courage in
the peril of success, hast thou fortitude sufficient
for this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Syrian party had unconsciously drawn closer
together, away from the motley crowd of late-comers
who were striving to make themselves comfortable
in the shadow of the walls and were fighting energetically
for the best places. The king&#8217;s representatives,
in another group, were making a determined
onslaught upon the stout gates with their
swords and spears. Lemuel again drew near Isaac,
this time in hurried pompousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer thou wisely,&#8221; he said in an undertone.
&#8220;He meaneth to reward thee. Remember that I
have been thy friend, thy companion since boyhood,
intimate enough for such jesting as I had with thee
a moment ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac shook off the counsel impatiently. His action
had been inspired with no thought of reward,
save in the joy of the little maid; yet Naaman was
rich and generous and a gift not unlikely. If given
a choice, he knew what he should ask. He had considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the matter, but the plan did not include
Lemuel. The latter fell back a pace. His words
had reached no other ears than those for whom they
were intended, being drowned in the din of the
pounding on the gate. Naaman, amiable in the
delight of physical relief, gave a few brief directions
and his party settled down to waiting with whatever
calmness they could muster. Audible complaints
ceased. At last, on top of the city wall, a watchman
was seen approaching from the tower at the far
corner. At first a speck in the distance as he made
the rounds of the wall leisurely, he finally stood
near enough to the gate to survey the assemblage
outside. With unsympathetic eye he viewed the
poorer travelers and the belated merchants, but a
change came over his countenance as he beheld the
king&#8217;s representatives and the Syrian embassy. Instantly
he disappeared within the city and the party
without drew a sigh of content.</p>

<p>Yet the gate was not opened; that is, not the great
gate. A smaller one within the larger was flung
wide and the watchman appeared with obsequious
interest: &#8220;Behold the needle&#8217;s eye. Enter thou and
thy beasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men could get through readily, and even the
horses could with difficulty, but hard is it indeed
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle!
They were made to kneel and then, with much
tugging and cursing and shouting their drivers at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
last succeeded in getting them through its narrow
space. The asses required almost as much effort,
having to be unladen and their burdens strapped
upon them once more on the city-side of the gate.
Finally, only the chariots and the least important
luggage remained under guard without while the
watchman closed the small gate decisively against
the envious groups left deriding and pleading and
cursing in the shadow of the walls.</p>

<p>The next morning Naaman&#8217;s company again
stood before the abode of Elisha. Again was it
surrounded by gaping throngs. Again had the city
of Samaria cause to be both curious and joyful.
Did not all wish to gaze upon this great foreign diplomat
who had been healed in the Jordan? Did
not his recovery mean that war had been averted
from Israel? What would he say to the prophet
and what part of his goodly treasure would he leave
behind? Part of this question had been answered
before it had been asked; answered before he left
the palace, when he had proffered a gift to the king,
a gift generous in itself but small in comparison
with what he had brought, most of which was intended
for the Man of God.</p>

<p>Naaman&#8217;s visit to the prophet, however, had an
even greater significance than the crowd surmised.
In fact, his errand was threefold. First, he had
come to bring a thank-offering. Second, he wished
to make public confession of his belief in that Jehovah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
who, though Israel&#8217;s national God,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> should
now be his own. Third, he desired greatly to have
the prophet&#8217;s advice on a matter which weighed
heavily upon his mind. This time he was not required
to deal with the servant, Gehazi. Instead,
with all the elaborate courtesy of the East, Naaman
was received by Elisha in person. Not with the abruptness
and haste which we of the West are pleased
to call &#8220;business,&#8221; but with deliberation and delicacy,
Naaman made known his errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold, now know I that there is no God in all
the earth but in Israel; now therefore, I pray thee,
take a blessing of thy servant,&#8221; and Naaman
stretched forth his hand toward the camels laden
with treasure, those rich stores of which Damascus
was proud and which, brought in this form, was
the current idea of wealth.</p>

<p>Elisha demurred. &#8220;As the Lord liveth, before
whom I stand, I will receive none.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman stared. Surely he did not mean it. This
was merely the usual reluctance, the hypocritical
hesitancy which might be expected. All over the
Orient it was customary to give presents to the
various holy men who were successful interpreters
of the wills of their respective gods, and none ever
refused. This man had a different manner: a courtesy
without servility, an assurance without bigotry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
self-respect without self-esteem, but he was human!
Once and again Naaman urged acceptance of the offering,
but Elisha was firm. A murmur of surprise
ran through the ranks of the Syrians and Naaman
turned impatiently, commanding their withdrawal
that he and the seer might converse in private. Isaac,
sole attendant upon his master, as Gehazi was upon
Elisha, communed with himself: &#8220;So saith the little
maid,&#8221; and went over in his mind her protests
against this gift and his own worldly-wise replies.
So different was Jehovah from other gods! So unusual
a man was his prophet!</p>

<p>Finding insistence useless, Naaman with fine feeling
ignored the benefit he had thought to confer
and begged instead that a favor be granted him.
&#8220;Shall not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant
two mules&#8217; burden of earth?&#8221; From the land Jehovah
was supposed to especially bless Naaman
would take sufficient holy ground to erect in heathen
Syria an altar to this new God. &#8220;For thy servant
will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice
unto other gods but only unto Jehovah.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prophet graciously gave consent and dispatched
Gehazi with servants of their visitor to see
that proper attention be given the matter.</p>

<p>Naaman&#8217;s brow clouded as his host stood waiting
in dignified civility. Drawing nearer, he spoke in
tones which betrayed his agitation of mind. &#8220;In
this thing, however, the Lord pardon thy servant;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
that when my master, the king, goeth into the House
of Rimmon to worship there (for thou knowest that
my master, the king, leaneth upon the hand of thy
servant) and I must needs bow myself in the House
of Rimmon as its worship requireth; when I bow
myself I make request that the Lord pardon thy
servant in this thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the prophet did not speak and
Naaman waited anxiously. His was not a nature
which could practice deception or tolerate it in
others, yet between his own religious convictions and
his official duties as a member of the Syrian Court
was a great gulf fixed. Elisha&#8217;s answer fell upon
his hungry heart like a refreshing shower on
parched ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well. Go thou in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great soldier prostrated himself before the
seer, who politely bade him rise, and their farewells
over&mdash;those long farewells of the Orient&mdash;the
Syrian embassy turned its face homeward, wondering
greatly at what it had seen and heard.</p>

<p>Through the gate of the house just left peered a
frowning face. Gehazi, servant to the prophet, had
regarded his master&#8217;s decision concerning the gift
with some displeasure. True, Elisha was not poor,
but to allow wealth to pass as lightly through his
fingers as a man openeth his hand and droppeth seed
in sowing time! But stay, should not his own services
be rewarded with a little, a very little indeed, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
what this foreigner was reluctantly carrying away?
His eyes, lighted with cupidity, grew cautious as
they searched the apartments within for trace of his
master. In a moment he had shut the gate softly
and stepped outside.</p>

<p>Isaac, hearing behind them the footsteps of a
runner, looked backward curiously, checking his
horse. Naaman, hearing at the same moment, commanded
his charioteer to stop while he dismounted.
Walking a few steps toward the runner, whom he
perceived to be the prophet&#8217;s servant, he greeted him
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is all well?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man reassured him. &#8220;All is well, but my
master hath sent me, saying, &#8216;Behold even now there
be come to me from Mount Ephraim two young men
of the Sons of the Prophet. Give them, I pray thee,
a talent of silver and two changes of garments.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In answer to this request, Naaman generously insisted
upon giving more than was desired: &#8220;Be content,
take two talents,&#8221; and although Gehazi objected
with well simulated humility there was in his
tones no such decisive finality as had been present in
the voice of his master.</p>

<p>Calling two of the servants, Naaman saw to it
that they bore before the messenger the heavy silver,
cut and weighed, and the two changes of fine
raiment. Well satisfied that at least something of
all he had taken had been accepted, the Syrian captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
reentered his chariot and the party waited for
the return of the burden bearers. Isaac looked after
the trio questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There be many Sons of the Prophet,&#8221; he reasoned
with himself, &#8220;would their leader, the Man of
God, honor two above the rest? Nay, it seemeth
not so to me. Somehow I like not this man Gehazi.
Never once, in all of our dealings, hath he looked
my master or me straight in the eye!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same moment another mind was dealing
with the same problem. Gehazi, elated at Naaman&#8217;s
generosity, had been likewise perplexed. To receive
a present was one thing, to dispose of it quite another,
especially in view of the two servants who
carried the treasure and before whom he must act
the part of Elisha&#8217;s messenger as he had represented
himself to be. At the tower in the vineyard at the
foot of the hill he dismissed the men and took the
burden himself, staggering under its weight.
Within the house he hastily disposed of his new
possessions and betook himself to his master, wondering
if his absence had been noted and striving to
assume an air of innocence by busying himself about
necessary tasks.</p>

<p>Elisha&#8217;s keen eye rested upon the guilty countenance:
&#8220;Whence comest thou, Gehazi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy servant went no whither.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prophet&#8217;s righteous indignation was kindled
at the falsehood. &#8220;Went not my heart with thee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
when the man turned back from his chariot to meet
thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fear in the craven face opposite told its own
story. The prophet&#8217;s wrath overflowed. To have
upheld the honor of the Lord of Hosts and then
this misrepresentation! &#8220;Is it a time to receive
money and to receive garments and olive-yards and
vineyards and sheep and oxen and men servants and
maid servants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman
shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gehazi cowered, weeping and pleading, but the
stern edict had gone forth. Already he knew himself
to be the loathsome object Naaman had once
been, and at the same hour when Isaac lay down to
sleep with a smile upon his face, Gehazi rent his
garments and cried aloud outside the gate through
which Greed had driven him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


PLANS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Naaman</span>, freed from the bondage of physical
suffering, made plans for the future with all the
abandon of a joyous child. The first day of the return
journey he talked much with Isaac, whom he
graciously permitted to ride beside him, the target
for both the flattery and the malice of his less-favored
associates.</p>

<p>&#8220;There remaineth, Isaac, most of the treasure we
brought to this land, despite our trifling gifts to
King Jehoram and to the prophet&#8217;s servant for his
master&#8217;s almsgiving. Had it not been for thee I
should not now be healed. Behold, the gift is thine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac bowed low. &#8220;Nay, my lord, for had it not
been for the little maid we should not now be in
Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great man pondered. &#8220;The maid shall be
suitably rewarded, but what desirest thou for thyself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged the young soldier dared to
speak of what had been in his mind since that day
of healing at the Jordan. &#8220;Yea, my lord, much
more than thou wilt wish to give, but if, oh my lord,
I have found favor in thy sight, grant, I pray thee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
that Miriam be allowed to return to Israel and to
her home as she longeth to do, and that thou shouldst
also allow to return with the maid her brother Benjamin,
a friend to whom I am much indebted, but
who, being a shepherd, was carried into captivity
with his flock by Eleazer&#8217;s band about the time I
took Miriam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for thyself, Isaac, what for thyself?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier gazed beseechingly at the older man.
&#8220;For myself do I ask these things. Do they not
mean the reward of a conscience at peace? And
that is something, my lord, I have not had this long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman was silent a moment, lost in thought.
At last he spoke: &#8220;It shall be done, Isaac, even as
thou desirest, but more. This treasure will I divide
between thee and the maid, and when she is old
enough she shall be given thee in marriage. I see
thou hast a tender affection for her. It is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a gesture of dismissal Naaman was turning
away, but Isaac caught hold of the fringe of his
garment, speaking with unmistakable earnestness.
&#8220;Thou hast spoken truly, my master. I love the
maid as she cannot now comprehend and she loveth
me, but not in the way I would wish. There be many
kinds of love, and when she is old enough to consider
such things I pray thee help her to be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman could not hide his amusement. &#8220;I see,
Isaac, that I was not wrong when I accused thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
good looks of leading thee into experiences. Thou
speakest of love wisely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The amusement faded into seriousness. &#8220;Oft
have I thought, Isaac, that thou hast shown discretion
far beyond thy years. As thou knowest,
my steward groweth old. In time he must be supplanted
by a younger man, and even now he needeth
to lean upon the stronger arm of youth. Where can
I find one more diligent and less self-seeking than
thou? Behold, from henceforth thou shalt be no
longer a soldier, but greater responsibility shall be
given into thine hand. In time thou mayest be over
all of my substance as was thy father before thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac stammered his thanks, but its lack of enthusiasm
irritated his master. &#8220;Carest thou not
for the reward I would give thee? Peradventure
thou hast some other request. Speak and conceal it
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Isaac spoke, too utterly miserable to be prudent.
&#8220;Could I be born and grow up in thy house,
my master, and not wish to be even as thou art, a
man of war? Could I be thine armor-bearer and
not feel that war is more glorious than peace? Could
I be promoted to the captaincy of a small band and
not wish to lead a greater? Could I follow thee and
not wish to be like thee? Thy wealth thou hast inherited,
but the affection of the people thou hast won
by thine own valor, thine own worth. I had dreamed
even of this. Once I gained the favor of Naaman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Captain of the Host. Henceforth thou dost ask me
to seek only the favor of Naaman, the rich man.&#8221;
He ceased speaking, his breast heaving, tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Naaman stared at the dejected figure with incredulity
and growing displeasure. Why all this
show of emotion over a benefit he had thought to
confer? His kindness was misconstrued. His
thoughtfulness was considered intrusive. He was
defied and rebuked by a servant. Yet he might have
expected ingratitude. It was the way of the world.
He had imagined that Isaac was different, but he
had been disillusioned. His tones held the sadness
of disappointed hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had believed thou wert glad to serve me, Isaac,
but thou art like the others: thou wouldst rather
serve thyself. It is well that I should have learned
this before making any mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a disdainful gesture he turned from his one-time
favorite. Isaac, shocked into full understanding
of the mischief his tongue had wrought, dropped
to the rear of the chariot and by degrees to the rear
of the company, affecting not to see the curious
and surprised glances with which his action was
greeted by his companions. Lemuel rode forward
hastily. Passing Isaac he leaned from his saddle,
speaking in so low a voice that even the soldier nearest
could not catch the words, much as he tried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou fool! Knowest thou not his imperious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
temper? Couldst thou not bear with his impatience?
Thou shouldst have considered only the reward.
Thou hast had thy chance and lost it. Next to
thee he hath seemed to regard me with favor. Peradventure
the opportunity thou hast thrown away
will be mine. Behold, I go to do his bidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed his way to a place just behind the
chariot, where he rode for a time, respectful and attentive.
Naaman, saddened and perplexed by Isaac&#8217;s
outburst, accepted Lemuel&#8217;s attentions with a certain
degree of grateful appreciation which gradually
became relief and even pleasure, and when evening
fell, Lemuel&#8217;s tent was pitched next Naaman&#8217;s, in
the very center of the encampment, while Isaac kept
to the outer circle. The evening meal was long since
eaten; the bustle of the camp had quieted into the
soundlessness of night; not a figure moved among
the dark tent-shapes and masses of camp paraphernalia.
Even the pack-animals were quiet, but hour
after hour Isaac lay awake.</p>

<p>The stars looked at him with far-off, unsympathetic
faces. He was bitterly humiliated. Why
had he so rashly thrown away his master&#8217;s favor?
Why had he treated his future advancement as a
child would lightly discard a withered flower? It
was not merely of himself he should think, but what
would Miriam say when she knew? The impetuous
youth who had never faltered before a foe quailed
now, in imagination, before the clear vision of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
maid&#8217;s disapproval. And then the remedy flashed
through his mind. Discarding it at first as absurd
and impossible, he ended by weighing carefully
reasons for and against. At last he rose and
stealthily went for his tired horse. No watchman
questioned his action or interfered, but the significance
of this did not occur to him until afterward.</p>

<p>Leading the animal apart from the camp he
stopped in the shadow of a great rock. He was facing
the road which led to Damascus. A little farther
along there crossed it the no less important highway
which went down into Egypt. It was well known
to every traveler and each twist and turn of it had
been familiar to Isaac since his scouting days. He
would have no difficulty finding his way. Egypt was
his destination. There would he be a soldier. The
ruling power was always anxious to recruit its forces
with any foreigner willing to serve, and how much
more would he be welcomed when it was known that
his father had been an Egyptian!</p>

<p>Although the decision was made, the young man
hesitated. To be a soldier for pay, and pay alone!
To fight, not to defend the weak and repulse the
strong but to uphold the quarrels of a master he
should hate! To leave the impulsive, impatient but
kindly and generous Naaman, the only master he
had ever known! To cut himself off from jealous,
loving Milcah and repudiate the home of his mother!
Most of all, never to see the maid again! What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
would she think of this desertion? He shuddered at
the word, yet it was that despicable thing&mdash;desertion
of duty. He wavered an instant, then his face set
into lines of bitterness. By whatever name it might
be called it was necessary. Was he not already disgraced?
Had he not foolishly and without just
cause forfeited his master&#8217;s favor? Did he deserve
or could he expect sympathy or even respect from
Milcah and Miriam?</p>

<p>Still he did not start. Before his mind&#8217;s eye passed
quickly a panorama of all his dreams, now brought
to naught. Brushing a mist from his eyes he sighed
and mounted the fiery little steed of the desert, once
a gift from his master. Motionless he sat in the
shadow, staring, for down the road, like a moving
picture, came a band of mounted men. Was his
dream coming true? Was this the phantom command
he had often seen in imagination? And then
he came back to realities with a start. His horse
seemed to feel the suspicion which passed through
his rider&#8217;s mind and was instantly alert, responsive,
trembling slightly, but eager for the fray.</p>

<p>On the company came. There was no mistaking
the camels and the armed men, though not a sound
of their advance came to the sensitive horse and to
the man who crouched in the shadows, listening. It
was this silence which proclaimed their errand. They
were robbers coming by night with the feet of their
animals muffled, their object being no other than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Naaman&#8217;s treasure, upon which they hoped to pounce
while the camp slumbered, exhausted by a hard day&#8217;s
travel. And then it occurred to Isaac for the first
time that the watchmen should have seen and reported.
He remembered that he had noticed no
passing to and fro on the usual rounds. Was there
a traitor within the camp? But he had no time for
investigation. He lifted his face to the stars for an
instant and through the cool stillness of the night
sent a long, weird call.</p>

<p>It was the Syrian battle cry. The camp responded
without delay, and Isaac, dashing out of his shadowed
retreat, led the first charge against the oncoming
robbers, made desperate by the miscarriage
of their plans and the surprise of the attack. It was
a longer fight than might have been anticipated.
Their numbers were almost evenly matched and both
sides felt that so much wealth was worth fighting
for. Naaman&#8217;s party, however, had the handicap
of weariness, for its leader was pushing toward
Damascus at a forced speed. Isaac never understood
how it was that he and his master and Lemuel
became separated from the rest and cornered. He
only knew, with the clearness of vision which comes
in a time of emergency, that the chances were all
against them and in favor of the robbers.</p>

<p>In that moment, also, there swept over him the
certainty that he had never cared for Naaman the
soldier and even less for Naaman the rich man, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
that Naaman his master was dearer to him than all
the world except the little maid. He saw the battle-line
draw closer and closer about them. He noted
the spear-thrust which Lemuel avoided and which
Naaman, though he did not see, would soon feel unless,
by a quick movement on his own part&mdash;in
Isaac&#8217;s side he felt a sharp and agonizing pain as if
he were being burned with red hot lead. His
strength suddenly forsook him. Crumpled up on
the rocky road, held fast in the grip of a dull torture
and a nauseating weakness, the struggle surged
around and over him and he cared not, nor knew
when it ceased.</p>

<p>It was long past daylight when his dull eyes
opened upon his surroundings and his stiff lips tried
to frame a question. It was Naaman himself who
bent over him tenderly and answered with a matter-of-factness
in itself reassuring:</p>

<p>&#8220;Three of our men have we lost and four beside
thyself are dangerously wounded. The others are
able to be about the camp and to minister to the sufferers.
We shall rest here for two or three days and
then resume the journey slowly. Yea, the treasure
is safe and we have buried many of our enemies.
But rest thou and so shalt thy strength return.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker gave his patient a drink of something
that was cool and refreshing and bathed his wound
with a mixture of oil and wine which was supposed
to have great virtue in soothing and healing. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Isaac could not rest until one more query was answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>His articulation was feeble, but it was understood.
As his master stooped to reply two scalding drops
fell upon Isaac&#8217;s hand and the words came chokingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe&mdash;thanks to thy fidelity.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Naaman did a strange thing for one
who was merely a master. He gathered Isaac within
his arms and wept openly over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I should have forgotten how high flame
the fires of youth; its ambition and its courage and
its boldness; its longing for achievement and its impatience
of restraint. Yet of these is manhood born.
Ah, if thou stayest with me, Isaac, I will remember,
yea, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger man looked up into his face wonderingly.
Stay with him! What did he mean? He
was not going to Egypt. Not now. He was going
back to the little maid, and home. He was, however,
too weak and too weary to make explanations, so he
closed his eyes and when he opened them again the
stars were out once more and his master still lingered
beside him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


HOME</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the House of Naaman at Damascus all was
anxiety. As soon as the days were accomplished
when the caravan might return, a watchman was
stationed upon the roof to give tidings of its arrival,
but day succeeded day without sight of the
party itself or even a messenger. At least twenty
times between dawn and sunset did Miriam run
lightly up the stone staircase to her own favorite
spot. Shading her eyes with her hand she would
gaze long into the grayish distances and then, sighing,
descend to her mistress, who, weary with waiting
and unutterably distressed at the delay, had
ceased asking questions with her lips and now asked
them only with her eyes. When no gladness appeared
in Miriam&#8217;s expressive countenance, Adah
would sink back upon her silken cushions with one
brief exclamation:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as before. We could expect nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not even the little maid&#8217;s confident cheerfulness
could rouse her to hope. Added to the gloom of her
mistress, Miriam experienced other trials. Her
position in the household began to be somewhat uncomfortable.
She could not fail to be aware of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
whispered remarks, slighting, scornful, amused. If
a visit to the prophet who dwelt in the Land of Israel
were all that was needed for her master&#8217;s restoration,
why had he not returned ere this with the
healing predicted? The delay was proof positive
of the failure of his mission. And who had doubted
that it would fail? Certainly not they. Had they
not said all along that if Baal and Rimmon and
Chemosh and Tammuz and all the other gods could
do nothing, was it not highly improbable that this
Jehovah of Israel, of whom the maid was always
talking, could do more? And the idea of one in her
place offering advice to her master!</p>

<p>It was on a particularly trying day that anticipation
was changed to certainty. It needed not the cry
of the watchman nor the tense excitement with
which the household responded to apprize Miriam,
for in her own particular lookout on the roof she had
observed for herself. Far in the distance she had
noted moving specks which could be no other than
a caravan. Fascinated, hopeful, she had watched
its approach until assured from appearances that it
<i>might</i> be Naaman&#8217;s party. She had seen the sudden
paralysis of Damascus traffic and had heard the
exultant cry of the multitude, two marks of respect
accorded only the great and the popular. It <i>must</i> be
Naaman&#8217;s party! Slowly and with dignity the procession
moved through the narrow, crowded streets
amid the cheering throngs and came to a halt before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
the arched gateway. With wildly beating heart
Miriam knew that it <i>was</i> Naaman&#8217;s party.</p>

<p>Peeping over the parapet surrounding the roof,
she noted that the household had hurried into festal
garb and gone forth to meet its master in the solemn
joy of the dance, accompanied by the music of silver
trumpets and cymbals, stringed instruments and
timbrels. Her place was with them, but surprise
and dismay held her motionless for a long moment,
then she bounded down the steps and ran, panting,
to the apartments of her mistress. Adah, in excitement
scarcely less than Miriam&#8217;s but decidedly more
controlled, stood by the doorway, trembling and
waiting. Miriam, with white face, clutched her garment
and her voice sounded strange even to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mistress, knowest thou? Knowest thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could proceed no further. In Adah&#8217;s eyes the
light of happy expectancy slowly faded&mdash;and it had
shown there momentarily. In its stead came the
old, deep despair. Dropping back a pace she covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have known&mdash;oh I think I did know&mdash;yea,
I knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam, in utter misery, gazed at her fixedly.
&#8220;Thou knewest and didst not tell me. Thou didst
wait and let me find out for myself that his horse
is led and riderless and that they carry a prostrate
figure! Someone hath told thee and thou hast concealed
it from me. Oh, how couldst thou?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Adah moaned. &#8220;That he could not be healed I
felt, I knew, but that it is with him as thou sayest&mdash;Miriam,
art thou sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miriam was gone. With swift steps she
passed various members of the elated household.
With unseeing eyes she rushed past its master on
his way to his wife&#8217;s apartments, and though he
stopped and spoke graciously she noted not it was
he. Her objective was a room in another courtyard
where the figure she had seen was being tenderly
cared for. Here she knelt beside Milcah and
stroked Isaac&#8217;s hand, openly weeping over him;
took from the servant the cooling drink and administered
it herself; listened to an account of the battle
with the robbers and forgot to ask for Naaman,
and left the room only when she and Milcah were
satisfied that it was quite safe to leave him in the
hands of other attendants for the time being.</p>

<p>She was soon summoned to the apartments of her
mistress, where she prostrated herself before her
master, but he gently raised her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look upon me, little maid, and behold what thy
faith hath wrought.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timidly she raised her eyes as she was bidden and
the look lingered. To behold him thus restored!
Around the mouth which life had molded into sternness
played a little smile, to which the lips of his
wife and her handmaiden likewise responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well did I know that Jehovah would do this,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Miriam exclaimed, delightedly, &#8220;if my lord would
but go to the Man of God who dwelleth in Samaria
in the Land of Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah, with the lassitude all gone, drew Miriam
down beside her while the story was told from beginning
to end, and the little maid heard with such
great happiness that the attitude and the recital
seemed the most natural thing in the world and not
at all, as it was, an unusual piece of condescension.
Nor did either master or mistress appear to remember.
The tale finished and questions asked and answered
with entire frankness, Naaman suddenly
propounded a query.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now what wouldst thou, little maid? Behold,
a gift is thine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into Miriam&#8217;s eyes crept a certain wistfulness
and they entreated her mistress. Adah turned her
own away. Like the sharp thrust of a dagger she
remembered the girl&#8217;s wail on the day Naaman had
started to Israel and her own words of promise. Yet
how could they let her go? Oh, anything but this!</p>

<p>Miriam&#8217;s reply was not, however, what was expected
by either of her auditors. &#8220;A gift, my lord?
Nay, for I sought only thy good because I loved my
mistress and thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman&#8217;s keen eyes searched her face. &#8220;We express
our thanks by a gift, little maid. Speak thou
and be not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, my lord, let thy gift, I pray thee, come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Isaac, who deserveth it more. He it is who hath
brought this to pass more than thy handmaiden.
Thou wouldst not have listened to me, yet wert thou
ready to hear the servant in whom thou delightest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman toyed with the hilt of the buckler which
hung at his girdle. Strangely unselfish were these
Israelites. First the prophet, then Isaac, now
Miriam. &#8220;Yea,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;and Isaac shalt
have his reward, but something must be given also
to thee. Speak! What wouldst thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus importuned the girl hesitatingly voiced her
desires: &#8220;Thou knowest, my lord, that with great
anguish of spirit have I thought upon the distress of
my father and mother, bereft of both son and
daughter, and that with great longing have I desired
to know how it fareth with them. If, therefore,
I have found favor in thy sight, I pray that
thou wilt allow my brother, Benjamin, who is a
captive shepherd in the Syrian hill country, to return
unto them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah drew a sharp breath of surprise and relief,
but Naaman was not satisfied. &#8220;Yea, thy brother
shalt go. Isaac hath already asked this thing, but in
Benjamin&#8217;s hand he shall carry a gift to thy parents.
I have told thee that but a little is gone of all that
we took into Israel. What wouldst thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam&#8217;s decision was prompt. &#8220;If thou couldst
find it in thine heart to give him some of the sheep.
Thou knowest he hath tended them until they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
dear unto him, and with a few, my father&#8217;s flock
could again be restored.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman hastened to grant the request. &#8220;A few
sheep would be but small recompense for all that I
owe thee. He shall take the flock with its increase.
I will send a messenger to the palace and the king
will give orders to his servants that this be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam knelt before him, her face transfigured
with joy. &#8220;So good art thou to thy handmaiden,
my lord. I thank thee,&#8221; and slipped hastily away
while Naaman and his wife conversed long and
earnestly on a subject Adah presented and which
appeared to be of concern to the little maid, since
her name was frequently mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us consider well,&#8221; advised the man, gravely,
&#8220;and if thou art of the same mind a week or so
hence&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But evidently she was, for Miriam was again
summoned to appear before her master and mistress,
and in a maze of bewildered delight soon afterward
sought Isaac on the veranda, where his couch
had been placed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I am <i>daughter</i> to the House of Naaman,
thou who hast taught me so much must teach
me yet more,&#8221; she said with smiling confidence in
the help which had never been refused.</p>

<p>She was surprised at his averted head, his long
silence. When he did speak it was slowly and with
seeming difficulty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;When thou art daughter to the House of Naaman
it will not be my right to teach thee anything.
Then will I come into thy presence only to do thy
bidding. I shall be thy servant even as I am servant
to my master and mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile left Miriam&#8217;s face. She put her hand
on his arm and he covered it with his larger one.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Isaac,&#8221; she began, in a dismayed little voice,
&#8220;why, Isaac&mdash;&#8221; and got no further, for he went on
earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am glad for thee, Miriam, truly glad.
Thou art entirely worthy. Sweet art thou and refined
and teachable, and with the advantages they
will give thee thou shalt be second to none at the
court. They have chosen wisely, much as they
owe thee, and thou shouldst be grateful and pleased
at the honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled at her encouragingly, trying to steady
the voice which sounded so unlike his own, and went
on telling her all that the new position would mean
in responsibility and opportunity and happiness.
Very quietly she sat listening, her hand still in his,
but when Milcah came, bringing some nourishment
for the invalid, Miriam slipped away to her favorite
nook, trying to think calmly. Somehow joy had
fled.</p>

<p>It had gone for Isaac also. Over and over he
told himself how glad he was for her, and over and
over his heart mocked him with its own desolation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Never again would she come to him with her innocent
confidences; never again bring him her problems
to be solved; never again would he have the
sweetness of knowing that he was first to her! And
that was what he wanted; wanted it more intensely
than he had ever wanted anything in his life. Once
he had craved the affection of another maiden. Now
he wondered that he should have been carried away
by a fancy. That was a dream, an impossibility.
This was reality and likewise an impossibility, and
Isaac was unutterably wretched.</p>

<p>For a week Miriam avoided him, as he knew she
would henceforth, and then she sought him once
more as he moped in the courtyard. It was the same
Miriam he had always known. As if they had parted
but an hour ago she plunged into the continuation
of her tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to be daughter to the House of
Naaman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was startled. &#8220;Miriam! What right hast
thou to choose? Thy master and mistress hath
spoken. Naught is left for thee but to obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can always choose between right and wrong,
Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>He regarded her helplessly. &#8220;But what will thy
mistress say? She will be very wroth with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &#8220;Nay, for I have already
explained, and she is not wroth. She laughed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not understand. &#8220;Laughed? At what?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;I know not,&#8221; with a puzzled frown. &#8220;What
other answer could I make to her questions and her
planning but that I could not be daughter in the
house where thou art only a servant?&#8221;</p>

<p>A long moment of silence. One searching glance
and Isaac&#8217;s thrill was strangled by disappointment.
Quite frankly her eyes had looked into his. Very
matter-of-fact were the comments she was making
upon the sacredness of friendship and the gratitude
she felt for his great and constant kindnesses. He
resisted the impulse to laugh as her mistress had
done. The barbaric joy which her words had awakened
died prematurely. In a little while he was the
kindly, serious Isaac of her former acquaintance.
He drew her down on the stone seat beside him,
speaking in a tone of authority he had never used to
her before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit thou here while I speak plainly to thee.
Thinkest thou I shall let thee ruin thy future for the
sake of what thou canst not understand? Shall I
take advantage of thy innocent generosity to thine
own hurt? Am I so weak and my friendship so
poor, so mean that I will allow thy inexperience to
deprive thee of that which thou dost so richly deserve?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spared neither himself nor her. He told her
of the great riches of the House of Naaman, of its
power, of all the advantages which would be hers.
He reminded her that this was a childless household;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
that its mistress was lonely, needing a daughter&#8217;s
companionship; that he and Milcah would be proud
of her in the new relationship, and that she would
be able to accomplish much good for the name of
Jehovah, her God.</p>

<p>She was distressed at his reception of her tidings.
She wept at the sternness of his tone, but her decision
remained unchanged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thinkest thou I have not thought of all these
things, Isaac? Have I not been to the court with
my mistress and beheld its glory and its folly? It
would be wickedness to me. To be daughter in this
household would not mean to give more time or
greater service to my mistress, but less of both, for
would not my duties be increased? More than this,
as daughter here I must bow to Rimmon, but as
handmaiden I can serve Jehovah. Thinkest thou
the Lord, who looketh upon the heart, would be unmindful
of my deceit? Nor, as I have told thee,
would I thus ungratefully treat my friend. Thinkest
thou I could be happy were I to take precedence of
thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac was sternly resolved. &#8220;Miriam, thou must
take heed to what I say. Quickly, before it is too
late, thou must go to thy mistress and say&mdash;&#8221; but
Miriam had gone.</p>

<p>In her place stood Milcah, shocked and reproving,
as is the right of elder sisters. &#8220;I was passing
through the courtyard shrubbery and heard. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
she should tell a man what she told thee! And at
her age!&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac&#8217;s serenity unexpectedly returned. &#8220;That it
should be &#8216;at her age,&#8217;&#8221; mocking Milcah&#8217;s tone, &#8220;is
the only sad part of it to me. Would she were two
or three years older! Would she had whispered it,
hesitatingly and with a blush! Then would it have
pleased me better, but as it is, she knoweth not what
she hath said, and when she findeth out she will not
mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milcah&#8217;s sharp glance encountered one of the
maid servants lingering within a doorway, smiling
upon Isaac. The sight infuriated her, and by contrast,
Miriam&#8217;s friendly admissions appeared the
embodiment of frank childishness. She sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Useless is it to enlighten her or to chide thee,
for Miriam is just Miriam, and neither thou nor I
would have her different,&#8221; and so saying, Milcah
went her way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


DEVOTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gatekeeper at the House of Naaman was
extremely wise. Old and faithful and trusted, he
was an autocrat whose word few had the temerity
to question. For years he had admitted and dismissed
through that gate high and low, rich and
poor, distinguished and obscure, speaking to each
in his own tongue and with the manner his rank and
errand demanded. For this reason he felt entirely
competent to judge for himself of the worth of any
applicant for admission, without referring the matter
to higher authority. When, therefore, two
young men of poverty-stricken appearance and
speaking the language of Israel came, demanding
to see the master of the house, it required but a
moment to decide that their request should, by all
means, be refused.</p>

<p>They were undoubtedly grieved and disappointed.
The next day they came again, also the next and
still the fourth, but neither arguments nor persuasion
availed with the gatekeeper. Then they changed
their tactics. They pursued a policy of watchful
waiting, coming every day and crouching on the
roadway outside the forbidden walls from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
earliest beam of sunrise until its last faint glow in
the evening. Against such warfare as this the autocrat
of the gate was incensed, but not despondent.
Others had made like attempts at various times, but
had never been victorious.</p>

<p>To the sorely tried youths, their enemy&#8217;s resources
seemed unlimited. By turns he tried threats, blows,
indifference, sarcasm, and ridicule, enlisting the sympathy
and ready help of the assorted variety of
hangers-on who might always be counted upon to
linger in the vicinity of a rich man&#8217;s dwelling. To
the gatekeeper&#8217;s surprise and disgust, it was all useless.
Smarting under defeat and in great irritation
the old man carried his grievance to Isaac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right hast thou been to tell me,&#8221; the young
man assured him. &#8220;Either they be thieves watching
their opportunity, in which case the soldiers should
pay heed to them, or else they bear a message sufficiently
important to be heard. I will see them at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two on the roadway without held
converse in low tones. &#8220;Not in vain have we daily
watched these comings and goings,&#8221; said one, &#8220;for
much have we learned of the ways of the household
and the manner of behavior therein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, and what meaneth more to us,&#8221; responded
his companion, &#8220;much have we learned as to <i>whom</i>
it is that cometh and goeth: soldiers and servants,
merchants and mendicants and messengers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
various sorts as well as visitors of rank and distinction.
Of importance must this man Naaman
be and of considerable possessions. Thinkest thou
he will demand more than we can pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou knowest the alternative,&#8221; was the grim
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; went on the speaker, &#8220;also have we seen
the master himself, I take it, but never close enough
to have speech with him. Likewise hath the mistress
passed and a maiden who always goeth forth
with her, a maiden very gorgeously appareled and of
great beauty whom we supposed to be the daughter
of the house save that her looks betray a different
lineage. All these and more, yet never the young
soldier, Isaac by name, who carried her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if it were possible,&#8221; was the quick retort,
&#8220;I would be content not to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More concerned am I,&#8221; pursued the other, &#8220;that
he should not see me. He may remember that out
of his hand did I escape and seek to take me again.
Yet to redeem my promise and thy vow are we come,
and I shall not begrudge the price.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment an air of expectancy ran through
the group outside the portal, a thrill which communicated
itself even to the two who were conversing
and who, by reason of the hostility offered them,
had been obliged to surrender the strategic position
opposite the entrance and take refuge under the wall
at a little distance. The gatekeeper appeared, beckoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
violently. The idle pauper group, each individual
of which hoped this honor was for him,
crowded about the man, only to be repulsed with
grumbling curses. The two young men, having
learned to expect nothing but unkindness, merely
gazed and wondered. At last they became aware
that it was they who were being called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, thou gaunt tricksters. Thou of the
brawny arm,&#8221; to the younger, &#8220;and thou of the
burning eyes,&#8221; to the elder. &#8220;Thou Israelitish impostors!
Come and tell thy errand to the favorite
servant of my lord Naaman. Come quickly that
thou mayest be gone before he loseth patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two looked at each other questioningly, disregarding
the curious and envious eyes upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What new insult thinkest thou&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the gate limped a soldier very little older
than themselves and halted before them with a
grave salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace be unto thee if thy errand be peace.
Naaman, my master, goeth forth on a matter for
the king. Quickly, therefore, thy names and what
it is that bringeth thee hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young men bowed low before him and the
elder made the necessary explanations.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long and toilsome journey hath thy servants
taken and one beset with danger, and five lean and
hungry years have they spent in preparing that they
might speak to the master of this house concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
a matter on which only he can speak with both knowledge
and authority. So I pray thee, if thy servants
have found favor in thine eyes, grant that their request
be carried to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be done,&#8221; the soldier answered, tersely,
after a momentary hesitancy, and conducted them
forthwith past the sacred gate and the once frowning
gatekeeper (now all smiles) to the outer courtyard.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he left them and scarcely had they
time to observe the magnificence of the surroundings,
when he returned, a few steps behind his master.
The latter suffered the usual elaborate salutations
of the East with visible irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The king&#8217;s business, on which I go, requireth
haste,&#8221; he told them, thoughtlessly speaking in
Syrian. &#8220;State thy errand in as few words as possible
that I may tarry but briefly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder of the two, continuing to act as spokesman,
bowed low before the soldier, who was standing
apart: &#8220;Thy speech is that of Israel and thy
master is not able to understand thy servants. I
pray thee stand near that thou mayest tell thy lord
what thy servants say and tell them what he saith.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile played round the soldier&#8217;s mouth. &#8220;Nay,
for my mother, who was of the Land of Israel,
taught its tongue to my master, whom she nursed.
Say on and he will understand. Long hath Isaac&#8217;s
people served the House of Naaman.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;Isaac?&#8221; The question&mdash;or exclamation&mdash;was
like the swift thrust of a sword dividing friend from
friend. The speaker drew back with hostility in
eye and voice. &#8220;Thou art Isaac?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier wonderingly assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then thou art he who hath brought us hither.
Five years and more,&#8221; sternly, &#8220;hast the captivity
of a maid been on thy conscience, if thou hast a
conscience; a maid whom thy soldiers stole from
Hannathon in the Land of Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprise, resentment, and then infinite sadness
overspread Isaac&#8217;s countenance. &#8220;Nay,&#8221; he said
gently, &#8220;not five, but twenty-five, fifty, an hundred,
hath been the years of my remorse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The travelers exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do we not need to be told how it hath fared
with the maiden,&#8221; said the spokesman, and turned
his back upon the soldier, addressing Naaman in the
tongue of Israel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy servants be Eli and Nathan, from the city
of Hannathon in the Land of Israel, and we have
come to redeem out of thy hand this captive maid,
Miriam by name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman frowned, and he spoke slowly. &#8220;Thy
words do I comprehend but not thy meaning. &#8216;Redeem,&#8217;
thou sayest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of his bosom Eli drew a piece of sheepskin,
which he carefully unwrapped, displaying two huge
bracelets and a ring.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;When these are weighed, my lord, thou wilt find
that they are of considerable value.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman exchanged a look with Isaac and assumed
an air of sternness. &#8220;And when the truth
is known thou wilt be found to have stolen them.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the faces of the two young men was blank
despair. &#8220;Say not so, my lord. It is the product of
five years and more of toil for us in the fields and
vineyards of Abner of Hannathon. Robbed of his
flocks and herds and his stores of oil and wine by
the same hand which made Miriam&#8217;s parents desolate&#8221;&mdash;he
paused and cast a contemptuous glance at
Isaac, who winced as if he had received a blow&mdash;&#8220;naught
had he left but his land, so he agreed with
us for wages, and the God of our fathers, who heard
the sighs of the maid in captivity, also prospered
Abner and us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman surveyed the jewelry appraisingly. &#8220;Five
years&#8217; wages for two would scarcely equal their
value. Thou hast obtained them by fraud. Peradventure
even now he for whom thou wert hirelings
mourneth his loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Genuinely distressed, tears came to the eyes of
Eli. &#8220;Nay,&#8221; he said, eagerly, &#8220;my lord misjudgeth
his servants. Privation hath been sister unto Toil
and both have been sweet unto us for the hope
wherewith we were comforted. My lord can see
that these be the hands of workers&mdash;&#8221; he stretched
open palms toward Naaman and commanded Nathan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
to do likewise. &#8220;These are not the hands of
those who live delicately on the earnings of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naaman surveyed their hardened and calloused
hands, to which his attention had been directed,
but he saw yet more: their emaciated appearance,
their coarse clothing, above all, their earnestness, but
he seemed to find no words.</p>

<p>Slowly Eli drew from his bosom another and yet
smaller piece of sheepskin and unwrapping it, passed
it without speaking to Naaman. The latter looked
long and with surprise, examining it diligently and
commenting briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pearl of great price. It hath never belonged
to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; assented the spokesman. &#8220;It is a gift
from Judith, kinswoman to Miriam and wife of
Abner, who considereth herself to blame for
Miriam&#8217;s capture. Loath was I to take it, but she
besought me with tears and we reflected that what
might mean much to the maid was but a little thing
to Abner, so we hearkened to his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted momentarily
when Lemuel, bowing low and with many apologies,
crossed the courtyard hurriedly and whispered a
message in Naaman&#8217;s ear. With a hasty glance at
the sun the great captain turned to Eli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put up thy jewels into thy bosom. Very dear unto
her mistress is the maid, and the sum thou canst
offer tempts me not. Nay, for I would tell thee&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>With one dismayed look at his brother Eli spoke
again with calm finality: &#8220;Then one thing more do
we bring my lord, all that we have to give. Let, I
pray thee, thy servants remain as thy bondmen and
let the maid return to Israel and to the mother who
yearneth for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger brother now advanced, prostrating
himself and echoing Eli&#8217;s request: &#8220;Let Nathan
and Eli serve thee as thou seest fit, but let not the
maid remain in captivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank admiration beamed from Naaman&#8217;s countenance.
&#8220;Nay, not as bondmen shalt thou remain
in this house, but as guests. Meat and drink shall be
set before thee and changes of raiment shall be
brought. Thou shalt see the maid and have audience
with her mistress. Much of gratitude and affection
do we owe Miriam, and if it please my wife to let
her go into Israel, naught of what thou hast offered
would we take, but a gift should she carry in her
hand. Already hath request for the maiden&#8217;s freedom
been made by my well-beloved servant, Isaac,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward the gate they had entered flitted a smiling
maiden, attended by an older woman and a maid
servant. She stopped to pick a flower from the
courtyard garden. Two women passed and she
spoke to each, not with familiar chat, but with pleasant
authority, both hurrying off to do her bidding.
As the three entered a chariot which was in waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and to which she was assisted with every mark of
respect, she turned her head and the visitors saw
that it was the gorgeously appareled maiden they
had once supposed to be the daughter of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold,&#8221; said Naaman, &#8220;the maid whom thou
seekest. She goeth&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A rush of faintness caused Eli to lean heavily
upon his brother. It was not <i>this</i> Miriam for whose
sake they had toiled and suffered, but a Miriam poor
and abused and possibly degraded. Upon the stone
floor of the courtyard Eli fell. It was the tragedy
of an unnecessary sacrifice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


TIDINGS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> out on the Syrian hills a mother
caressed her babe. &#8220;Awakest thou, little one?
Knowest thou that when thine eyes open it is as if
sunrise had come and when thou closest them again
it is as sunset?&#8221;</p>

<p>The exultation went out of her face, but the tenderness
remained in her voice. &#8220;To think, joy of
my life, that thou shalt never know thine own people!
Never shall the eyes of thy father&#8217;s father or
thy mother&#8217;s mother behold thy sweetness and delight
in thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next words came with a low intensity like
the fierce growl of some mother-beast called upon
to defend her young: &#8220;Always shalt thou be a
stranger in a strange land with not even memories,
such as thy father and I enjoy, to console thee.
Scorn and misunderstanding and bitterness of spirit
shall be thy portion forever. O little son, dearly as
I love thee, how can I bear to see thee grow into manhood
thus?&#8221; Her bosom heaved and her eyes suffused
with tears.</p>

<p>She was startled by a long, low peal of thunder
and a great gust of wind which blew violently into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the tent through the raised flap. With the babe in
her arms she went quickly to this opening, which
served as both door and window, and peered out
anxiously. A few large drops of rain were already
falling, giving promise of the deluge which came
suddenly, even as she looked. For some reason the
babe wrinkled up its tiny face and began to wail.
The woman, with a quick movement, let fall the curtain
flap and retreated from the entrance, soothing
the child meanwhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, little son, it is not Rimmon, whom these
Syrians sometimes worship as the sun-god and sometimes
as the storm-god. He is not, as they believe,
punishing his people for their sins, lashing them
with the fury of the storm. It is Jehovah, sending
rain that grass may grow upon the hills to provide
food for his creatures. Surely, none knowest better
than thy mother that he is of tender mercy. Nay,&#8221;
as the cries grew louder, &#8220;weep not even for thy
father. Long before thou and I thought of rain he
had sensed the storm and securely hidden his sheep
in some cave of the mountains where the forethought
of the shepherds hath already stored food
for such emergencies. Skillful and tender and
watchful is thy father. The worst for us is that we
shall have to spend the night alone, so far from the
sheepfold and the tents of other shepherds. Shall
we sit here, just within the door, where we can see
what passeth without, heart&#8217;s delight?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Suiting the action to the word she lifted the tent-flap
a little and peered out, uttering an exclamation.
&#8220;It is hard to see through the blinding rain and the
wind, sweet one, but someone cometh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she looked. &#8220;It is not sheep, and so I know
it is not thy father. Rather it seemeth like a chariot.
Yea, it <i>is</i> a chariot with horsemen before and behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>She clasped the babe to her in an agony of apprehension.
&#8220;Only king&#8217;s messengers ride with chariot
and horsemen. They come in haste, as if on urgent
business. They will stop when they see the tent and
seek shelter from the storm. And thou and I alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had she ceased speaking when she detected
that the little company was, as she feared,
preparing to halt. The foremost horseman dismounted
and, approaching the tent, entered with an
air of insolent authority. The woman, face to face
with her intruder-guest, drew back in fear. He
smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twice,&#8221; he said, &#8220;nay, thrice hast thou escaped
me. Once in the gorge in Israel when thou fedest
wild pigeons and knew not thou wert observed;
once as we journeyed toward Damascus, and again
in Damascus itself. Thrice had I thee in my power.
Wert thou not <i>my</i> captive? Thrice hast thou escaped
through the help of thy friend&mdash;peradventure
more than friend&mdash;Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman lifted her head proudly, resenting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
sneer, a torrent of indignant denials on the end of
her tongue, but his manner immediately became conciliatory:
&#8220;Yet though the gods, who have ever
been kind to me, have brought thee into my hand
once more, and there be no Isaac near to secure thy
release, thou hast no cause for alarm. Only speak
thou favorably of me to the maiden I have brought
hither and all shall be well with thee and with thy
husband and babe. Refuse, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His words were cut short by the arrival of the
rest of the party, who crowded into the tent unceremoniously,
but though the threat was unspoken, the
woman shuddered. It was as if personified Evil
had intruded into the sacredness of Home. Retreating
as far as possible into the dim shadows of the
tent&#8217;s interior, she watched apathetically the entrance
of two women, heavily veiled. That they
were persons of importance was evidenced by the
deference with which they were treated by the
soldier-escort, chief of whom was Lemuel.</p>

<p>The older woman was speaking querulously:
&#8220;Never should we have come to seek those who are
but wayfarers. Saidst I not to thee that only storms
and uncertainty would be our portion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her companion, evidently much younger, answered,
soothingly: &#8220;Yea, and many more discouragements
didst thou prophesy, but said we not
that none of them should delay the message of joy
we carry, for is not Jehovah able to deliver us out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of them all? See how he hath now provided shelter
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lemuel, dropping the tent-flap, which he had held
as the two entered, bowed deferentially to the last
speaker: &#8220;Rightly hast thou spoken, Miriam.
Blessed be the name of Jehovah, as I learned in our
recent visit to Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was noticeable that the girl did not return the
smile but drew away somewhat coldly. The woman
within the shadows suddenly recovered her self-possession,
noting that this was the tongue of Israel
and not the despised Syrian. Hastening forward
she spoke those courteous words of greeting which
no Oriental householder would, under any circumstances,
omit, placing her services and her possessions
entirely at the disposal of the strangers and
drawing the two females of the party into the
woman&#8217;s portion of the tent while the men made
themselves quite at home in the other and larger
section.</p>

<p>The younger traveler received these kindly ministrations
of her hostess with a wondering hesitancy.
&#8220;Thou art not&mdash;thou canst not be&mdash;&#8221; she began,
then, throwing aside the drenched veil worn on the
journey, she peered intently into the face which
could not be seen plainly in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy voice,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;and what I can see
of thy countenance&mdash;&#8221; and then a glad cry rang out:
&#8220;Thou <i>art</i> she whom Milcah and I have sought, lo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
these many days. Thou art Rachel, wife of my
brother Benjamin. Blessed be the name of Jehovah,
who hath brought us to thee safely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, blessed be the name of Jehovah!&#8221; piously
echoed the men of the party, but two of them exchanged
glances partly amused and partly sinister
yet altogether significant.</p>

<p>It was an evening of joy. After the tiny lamps
had been lighted and the wayfarers had eaten, Rachel
listened to Miriam&#8217;s recital in amazed incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;That we should return to Israel when we had
despaired of seeing our kindred again! That our
son should be reared in the land of Jehovah instead
of in this country of many gods! And that we
should return as thou sayest, not as those who flee
from an enemy but with a gift in our hand, the
sheep that Benjamin loveth, nay, I have not heard
aright. Truly thy master is good unto thee and unto
us. And thou wilt come also?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Miriam struggled with emotion.
&#8220;Nay,&#8221; she declared with sad finality, &#8220;thou must
know that since my master&#8217;s healing at the hands of
the Man of God, Jehovah only doth our household
worship and there be none to teach them his ways
when I am gone. Besides, is it not Benjamin and
the flock which will be of most help to our parents?
What am I that I should ask more when I have already
been granted much?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Her lip quivered and very unexpectedly she found
herself weeping in Rachel&#8217;s arms. The cords of
captivity, however entwined with love, have ever
been found to cut the very heart-strings! The
storm without almost drowned conversation within
and very early, sleeping mats were unrolled in both
sections of the tent, the lights were extinguished and
silence reigned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All day long the same rain had dripped and drizzled
upon the streets of Damascus, driving its inhabitants
to shelter. All day long the several courtyards
of Naaman&#8217;s house had been deserted and the
two young men from Israel, guests for several days
under its hospitable roof, waited in isolation and
impatience for the interview they had been promised
with Miriam and her mistress. Instead, a servant
had come with a courteous message to the effect that
the maiden was on a short journey and Adah was
indisposed, but it was hoped it would please them to
abide there for a time, and so they had remained.</p>

<p>Some time during the night the wind changed and
drove a fine spray through the lattice, sprinkling the
sleepers below and slapping them in the face with
its raw breath. Nathan sprang to his feet with an
exclamation of disgust, dragged his quilt-mattress
to another and dryer part of the room and was soon
dreaming again that he was a soldier with a commander
who looked extremely like Isaac.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Eli too arose, but with greater deliberation. Peering
through the lattice into the inky blackness without,
he sighed. &#8220;Rain coming with a quiet steadiness
that seemeth to deluge my heart with its cold torrent.
Persistence hath the power of accomplishment.
Already are the roads washed out and a long
winter must we remain in Syria before travel to
Israel will be safe or comfortable. And the mother,
old before her time, bent under the weight of misfortune
like an olive tree before a storm, can she
endure? So different hath been our coming from
all we had planned! To find the maid well treated,
even honored and beloved, how it would hearten the
mother could we but send her word! And yet&mdash;what
if Miriam should not wish to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Others there were in the House of Naaman who
felt the wind&#8217;s rough caress. Isaac, in no wise discomfited
by the spray, as became a soldier, merely
moved away from the lattice, but drowsiness had
fled. A thought of Miriam came to him. She
would be greatly disappointed that she must wait
throughout the long, wet months of winter, for when
she should learn that Eli had come, she would desire
to start for Israel at once. Now the rain had
made it impossible and his heart was filled with a
great pity, even though her going meant more to
him than he dared to dwell upon. Perhaps, in all
that great abode, Adah, its mistress, alone felt
pleased over the storm. Staring into space with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
wide-open eyes for hours, she had listened to the
rain&#8217;s gentle patter, listened with a kind of fierce joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Until spring Miriam cannot go,&#8221; she whispered
to herself. &#8220;Months must she abide here. Blessed
respite! But how can I spare her at all? She who
hath been the sunshine, the courage, the hope in our
time of darkness and distress. She who hath taught
me to be happy as she said she would. Ah, empty
will be the house and dreary the days without our
little maid!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For two days the storm expended its fury. The
third dawned clear, and a wind which threatened to
tear down the tent dried the soaked earth. The
fourth found Benjamin, with his sheep, pushing forward
with as much speed as the safety of his flock
would permit, anxious for the welfare of his loved
ones. He was surprised and delighted to greet his
unexpected guests, and with a joy scarcely less restrained
than Rachel&#8217;s listened to the wondrous tale
his sister had traveled so many miles to bring him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But thou also shalt ask to go. Behold, is not
the House of Naaman indebted to thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &#8220;There is no debt, but
if there were, would it not be more than repaid when
thou and thy flock are restored to those who need
both? And thou wilt tell my mother that I have
kept the Lord alway before my face, even as she
bade me promise.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>The voice faltered, and Benjamin put an arm
about her. &#8220;Be of good courage, little maid. Thinkest
thou Isaac will let thee weep for thy kindred?
Nay, but he will speak to his master and he to thy
mistress, and when we start for Israel in the spring
thou shalt go also. Rest thou in hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam tried to smile and, saddened that the
storm should have rendered her errand futile, but
rejoicing in the confidence it had inspired, she lingered
yet another day and took her departure. Almost
at the last moment Rachel drew her aside for
a whispered word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put no confidence in this Lemuel who hath
charge of thy party. Not now can I explain, but
I fear for thee if thou dost trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam nodded. &#8220;Isaac told me the same and
wished greatly that I wait until he should be well
enough to bring me himself or spare his servant, but
the tidings seemed too joyful to delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Milcah, Miriam&#8217;s perpetual shadow, put in a
word: &#8220;And so my brother besought his master that
I be allowed to come with the maiden, and our mistress,
who can deny her nothing, hastened the plans
lest disappointment befall her.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a little distance Lemuel was talking confidentially
with a fellow soldier. &#8220;Pleased am I that
our errand hath ended well,&#8221; he was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; rejoined the other with a sneering smile,
&#8220;pleased if it please the maid and, better still, pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
if it please her master and mistress, for very dear
unto them is Miriam since Naaman&#8217;s healing. So
shall thine own schemes be furthered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lemuel frowned. &#8220;My creditors agreed to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the gods, whom thou art always boasting
have thee in their favor, have given thee this opportunity.
How much thinkest thou is the treasure
which hath been given to the maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was time for the little company to start
back to Damascus and with a sigh of relief Lemuel
took his place at its head. He gritted his teeth as,
obeying his order, the man to whom he had been
speaking took a place in the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better were this Jehovah-worshiping maid than
thy insolence,&#8221; he said under his breath. &#8220;May the
gods help me to find favor in the eyes of the maid
and most of all in the eyes of her mistress, who holdeth
the maid&#8217;s future and the maid&#8217;s fortune in her
hands!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


MEETINGS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a guest-chamber of the House of Naaman Nathan
hovered anxiously around his brother. They
had heard the happy announcement of Miriam&#8217;s
return, had seen the great house transformed into
a scene of busy festivity as if some honored guest
were about to arrive, had even stood at a distance
and observed the bit of rivalry between the soldier
who had brought her hither and Isaac, who assisted
her to alight from the chariot into the arms of her
waiting mistress, had noted the happiness in her
countenance and had turned away, sick at heart.
Later the servant who had been in almost constant
attendance upon them had come to name the hour
when they would be conducted to Adah&#8217;s apartments,
but for the present they were quite alone.</p>

<p>Eli spoke dully, his whole attitude one of extreme
dejection: &#8220;Strong were we to labor when we
thought of the maid despised and ill-treated. Sacrifice
was as sweet to us as the cool air of morn. Joyful
were we as they who conquer in battle when we
had this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this&mdash;&#8221; touching the
separate pieces of jewelry which lay in a glittering
heap beside him. &#8220;Enough and more did we deem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
them for her ransom, yet how little it profiteth! All
of her impressionable years have been spent in the
midst of such plenty, such riches as we in Israel
knew not existed save in kings&#8217; houses. Nor hath
she been required to labor. Peradventure she scorneth
toil. Her master refuseth to let her go, and
she would not wish to be redeemed even if we had
sufficient gold to purchase her freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>He regarded the jewelry at his side with disdain.
&#8220;Take it, Nathan. Let me never see it more nor
speak thou of it to me. Wasted is our work, ill-spent
are our years, blasted are our hopes. It is as
a pomegranate tree which a man planteth in his vineyard
and careth for, and lo, when it might have
borne, the frost killeth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He relapsed into bitter musings while his brother
took the gold as he was bidden and, wrapping it
carefully in its sheepskin coverings, put it in his
bosom. Eli silently passed him the pearl, but neither
of them looked at it, nor did they observe a figure
which approached stealthily, peered through the partially
opened door, and departed a little distance,
remaining near enough, however, to note the comings
and goings from that particular portal.</p>

<p>Eli was speaking again in the same despondent
tone: &#8220;Peradventure she will have for us naught
but contempt, and brought up in this heathen splendor
she may not even care to remember her home in
Israel, nor the mother who weepeth for her, nor the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
God of her fathers. Come, let us return before her
words and actions reveal to us this shame. In an
hour we are to see her, so the servant hath said. Let
us hasten and depart lest a greater sorrow be
ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan pressed him back into the seat from which
he had risen. &#8220;Thou art beside thyself with grief
and disappointment. Nay, but we will see the maid.
We will tell her wherefore we are come. If she
hath forgotten aught she should remember, we will
teach her gently and patiently as a mother teacheth
her babe, and we will plead for that mother whose
heart will break if we return with ill news. Nay,
but we will quit ourselves like men, and if there be
blame, it shall be upon the maid and not upon us.
Do thou remain here while I step into the courtyard
and see if the servant cometh who is to conduct us
to the apartments of her mistress. Wait, I say,
until my return.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Eli waited. As Nathan crossed the threshold
no servant was in sight, and, attempting to shake
off the gloom which weighed upon him in spite
of attempted cheerfulness, he walked slowly down
the courtyard, turned into an adjoining one and
crossed to yet another before he realized, with a
start, that he was in unfamiliar surroundings. Lost
in thought, he had not noticed that he was followed.
Now, halting in confusion and seeking to recall how
he had come, he was confronted by a figure oddly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
familiar. There was neither formal salutation nor
friendly greeting, but only a look of insolent amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;So thou hast changed thy mind,&#8221; said the newcomer.
&#8220;Once thou didst refuse to remain in the
company which would have brought thee straight
to this house. Five years later thou hast come of
thine own free will. Peradventure reflection hath
brought wisdom, yet thou shouldst have known it
was dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan was startled. The speaker continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isaac knew thee not yesterday, but thou couldst
not so deceive me. Thou art the lad who once escaped
out of his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan considered it prudent to appear fearless.
&#8220;Thou art Lemuel,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;the soldier
who captured Miriam and me in Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast guessed rightly,&#8221; went on the other.
&#8220;I am Lemuel, who forgetteth neither friend nor
foe. One word from me to my master, Naaman,
and thou wouldst indeed serve as bond-servant, not
willingly but by right, for wert thou not fairly taken
in war?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan determined upon escape, but the watchful
Lemuel laid a detaining hand upon his shoulder.
&#8220;Yet I may not speak that word, or, speaking it,
may soften the tone with a gift. Thou canst procure
thine own ransom more easily than the
maiden&#8217;s. The same gold intrusted to me for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
master&mdash;&#8221; he paused to give the better effect to his
words.</p>

<p>Nathan was distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or the pearl,&#8221; went on Lemuel, &#8220;and it may require
all. Thy fate is in thine own hands. Come,
what sayest thou? Which shall it be, thy freedom
or thy gold? Thou hast not long to debate the matter.
Thinkest thou I know not that the treasure is
even now in thy bosom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan gave the speaker a quick glance of anxiety.
How could he know that?</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; continued his tormentor, &#8220;what is the
word that I shall speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the now thoroughly frightened lad could
frame a reply, Isaac stood before them. Frowningly
he addressed himself to Lemuel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will carry the word to our master, the word
that a guest in his house hath been intimidated and
an attempt made to rob him of his possessions. I
will not soften it, neither will he.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lemuel held up a deprecating hand. &#8220;Thou art
too harsh. Thou dost not remember that the lad
was a prisoner, taken in open warfare. Should he
not purchase his ransom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac replied by a look, one long look of scorn and
indignation, and Lemuel departed, failing miserably
to maintain his old-time swagger. Isaac watched
him, his lip curling. At last he turned to Nathan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadst thou intrusted thy treasure to him, never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
wouldst thou have seen it again, nor would my master
have known of the matter. Guard it and thyself
as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan stammered his thanks, wondering the
while if he had not been delivered from one peril
but to fall into another. He braced himself for the
ordeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man hath spoken the truth,&#8221; he confessed,
bravely. &#8220;Five years hath made a change in my
appearance, but look thou steadily upon my countenance
and thou wilt see that I am the lad who
escaped out of thine hand. Behold, it is revealed.
What owe I thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier regarded him with the same frank
admiration as had Naaman on the day previous.
&#8220;Thy courage is equal to thy resourcefulness and independence
of spirit. What a soldier thou wouldst
make! Not at first did I know thee, but soon did
thy brother&#8217;s words bring thee to remembrance.
Naught owest thou, for didst thou not guard and
guide the maiden, Rachel, who was very dear to a
friend of mine, a man to whom I owe my very life?
Nor have I any claim upon thee after this lapse of
time and we at peace with Israel and grateful because
of the healing of my master by thy great
prophet. Nay, fear not, but go in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan would have gone instantly and with joy
had he known the way, and so it came about that
once more was he indebted to the soldier against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
whom he had cherished resentment for five long
years. In the guest-chamber Eli had awaited his
brother&#8217;s return in profound melancholy. The
servant came to conduct them to the apartments of
Miriam&#8217;s mistress just as Nathan and Isaac reached
the threshold, but Eli sat still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why go?&#8221; he asked, mournfully, in reply to
Nathan&#8217;s sharp remonstrance. &#8220;If we find, as seemeth
likely, that the maid hath chosen to forget all
she should remember: Israel the land of her birth,
her mother and her home, and more important than
all else, Jehovah her God, how could we carry the
tidings which would be sharper than a sword to the
heart of her mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac regarded the speaker with surprise. &#8220;Hadst
thou dwelt long in Damascus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thou
wouldst have heard that so far from forgetting Israel
and Jehovah, the maid hath remembered with
profit to the House of Naaman. The wonder of it
is on every tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>He recounted his master&#8217;s cure at the hands of
the prophet, ascribing the suggestion to Miriam and
praising her persistency. &#8220;In gratitude for this healing,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;Naaman and his whole house
have since worshiped only Jehovah, the God of Israel,
at which the maid greatly rejoiceth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli&#8217;s face glowed. &#8220;Sayest thou so? Upon coming
to Damascus we first sought Ezekiel to obtain
news of Rachel and to see if she knew of Miriam.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
Finding him long since dead and Rachel married
and somewhere out on the hills with Benjamin, her
husband, who is a shepherd, we then sought thee,
fearing to mention Miriam&#8217;s name or to betray our
errand lest obstacles be put in our way or our
treasure stolen. From Amos, seller of perfumes,
did we learn that one, Isaac, wast in the service of
Naaman at this house. From thee we hoped to
learn of the maiden&#8217;s whereabouts. Later we heard
that an Israelitish maid, Miriam by name, was also
here, so we sought to speak to the master.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, gazing at Isaac with a strange mixture
of diffidence and resolution. &#8220;We came,&#8221; he
went on, &#8220;thinking of thee as an enemy to be approached
with cautious dread. We find thee a friend
to whom we are much indebted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan nodded, telling briefly his experience just
past and joining his thanks to Eli&#8217;s, but Isaac waved
aside the praise and, dismissing the servant, himself
conducted them to the apartments where they were
expected. Miriam was nowhere in sight. Adah listened
languidly while Eli earnestly pleaded his cause,
Nathan, as usual, in admiring silence. Isaac paced
the courtyard without.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so because her master, thy husband, refuseth
to accept a ransom,&#8221; Eli supplicated, &#8220;even though
we have offered to become servants in her stead, I
have determined to ask of thee a gift&mdash;the gift of
the maid to her mother, who yearneth for her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>Restless under those burning eyes, jealous for the
reputation of her own household, she addressed him
haughtily: &#8220;The same request hath already been
preferred by Isaac, and although the maid is dear
unto us, yet to-day hath she been told that she is
not bound to the House of Naaman save by the
cords of affection. When the rainy season is over,
she is to go with her brother and his family, together
with his flocks and herds, back to the Land
of Israel, in the care of a captain and horsemen.
Behold, before thou camest thou hadst thy desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cutting short Eli&#8217;s bewildered expressions of
gratitude, she dispatched a servant in search of
Miriam. To the waiting ones, it seemed hours before
she came, although in reality it was but a few
minutes. It was her fifteenth birthday and she was
glowing with happiness, smiling radiantly upon the
little world inside the walls of Naaman&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Adah claimed her attention: &#8220;Another gift, little
maid, an unexpected one: tidings from thy home
in Israel brought by these two young men. Dost
thou know them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam turned, scanning their faces eagerly. Nathan
smiled and Eli began to speak, but she interrupted
with a joyous cry: &#8220;Eli! Nathan! How
tall thou art grown! And how didst thou ever find
me? But how glad I am, how very glad! Tell me,
my mother and my father&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the same Miriam Eli had last seen in Israel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Out in the courtyard Isaac heard the joyful
greeting and through the partly opened door his
eyes encountered Adah&#8217;s, looking past the young
people. She beckoned him to her side for a whispered
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear the little maid will no longer be <i>our</i> little
maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were spoken in so low a tone he
scarcely caught them, but they might have been
shouted and Miriam and her visitors would not have
heard. Isaac watched for a moment the little group
so absorbed each in the other and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; he admitted, sadly, &#8220;we have lost our
little maid and thou and I will sorrow most.&#8221;</p>

ISRAEL</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more it was spring. Once more were the
rains over and the air balmy and the water courses
quiet so that sheep might pass them and not be
afraid. Once more were faint paths made across the
sands of the wilderness and the stony hillsides by
caravans large and small, abroad on errands of
business or pleasure, and once more did the House
of Naaman pass a restless night, for on the morrow
Miriam was to depart for her beloved Land of Israel.</p>

<p>Roused from happy dreams, she could not understand
for a moment the medley of confused but
pleasurable sensations which surged over her; then
she remembered clearly. Eli had come long months
ago to take her back to things as they used to be,
back to her mother and father&mdash;nay, with a rush of
tears, not her father. Never again would she see
that fond expression in his eyes, never again hear his
kind voice, never again look upon his dear face.
And her mother, old and broken, she was told. She
could not realize it. Yet soon would she clasp that
mother in her arms; soon see her and know for herself.
To-morrow Isaac&#8217;s band would give the captives
in Syria safe conduct, Rachel and the babe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
riding in the chariot beside her, and Benjamin leading
his sheep before them. And all through this
time of waiting Eli had been here: Eli, who had
suffered with and for her, who had toiled and sacrificed
and then found it had been in vain. Oh, Eli
was so wonderful!</p>

<p>In another part of the House of Naaman he of
whom she thought was also awake, a little smile on
his lips, a little thrill in his heart. To have found
her unchanged and unspoiled in the midst of all this
heathen luxury! To have found her beautiful and
true and sweet! To have thought that he toiled for
the sake of the mothers, not knowing it was for
Miriam, not understanding that there was just one
maiden&mdash;only one!</p>

<p>But nights have a way of ending, and dawn came
as radiant as Miriam&#8217;s countenance when the household
thronged around the altar which had been
erected in one of the more private courtyards immediately
after Naaman&#8217;s return from Israel. In appearance
it was merely a raised mound made of ordinary
Syrian soil upon which had been spread the
&#8220;two mules&#8217; burden of earth&#8221; he had begged from
the Man of God. Thus hallowed by the sacred earth
from the locality in which Jehovah was supposed
to especially delight, it was considered a fitting place
for the burnt-offering which Naaman himself
piously sacrificed each morning.</p>

<p>This accomplished, the worshipers kneeling in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
petitions more or less heartfelt, they rose and the
service closed with a psalm of David, painstakingly
taught by Miriam to the household singers. To-day
the hymn concerned itself with the wonders of nature,
not in and for themselves as did the psalms of
the sun-worshipers, but extolling Jehovah as Lord
over nature.</p>

<p>Miriam&#8217;s voice led:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God,</div>
<div class="verse">And the firmament showeth his handiwork.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The chorus responded:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Day unto day uttereth speech,</div>
<div class="verse">And night unto night revealeth knowledge;</div>
<div class="verse">There is no speech, there are no words,</div>
<div class="verse">Neither is their voice heard.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet is their line gone out through all the earth,</div>
<div class="verse">And their words to the end of the world.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Miriam&#8217;s voice again:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;In them hath Jehovah set a tent for the sun,&#8221;</p>

<p>And the chorus once more:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,</div>
<div class="verse">And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.</div>
<div class="verse">His going forth is from the end of the heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">And his circuit unto the ends of it:</div>
<div class="verse">And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>At the close of the service Eli had speech with
Miriam for a moment. &#8220;They go now,&#8221; she told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
him, &#8220;to the House of Rimmon, where the old King
Ben-hadad leaneth for support upon the hand of
his well-beloved servant, Naaman, my master.
Isaac attendeth upon him. Thou wilt wish to go to
see for thyself this sun-worship while I wait upon
my mistress ere we depart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always thou hast refused to go,&#8221; Isaac reminded,
seconding the invitation, and Eli, after a little hesitancy,
consented.</p>

<p>Lemuel, with a smile meant to be friendly, joined
the group as Miriam hastened away. &#8220;Once more
hath Rimmon, our sun-god, vanquished the darkness
and started his victorious journey across the face of
the sky, but whether it be Rimmon, god of Syria,
or Baal, god of Ph&#339;nicia, or Jehovah, God of Israel,
let each worship according to the custom of
the land, say I.&#8221; He lowered his voice. &#8220;But didst
thou think that Naaman would risk the favor of the
king by importing a different God for worship at his
private altar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac sprang to his master&#8217;s defense. &#8220;It proveth
the generous kindness of the king, and is but what
might be expected in gratitude for healing at the
hands of Jehovah&#8217;s prophet. Did not Naaman speak
to Elisha, who refused to condemn his faithfulness
to his old master, the king?&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were all in the large and
splendid Temple of Rimmon, the pride of Damascus
architecture and decorating. It was beautiful with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
flowers, the air heavy with incense. Eli noted the
service, burdened with ceremony, the reverence during
the sacrifice of the burnt-offering, the earnestness
of the murmured prayers, the spreading out of the
hands in formal attitudes of supplication, the general
singing of hymns of praise. Even the lewd
dancing of the sun virgins filled him with pity rather
than horror.</p>

<p>He spoke his mind to Miriam as he rode beside
the chariot that afternoon on the way to Israel. &#8220;To
be so sincere yet so mistaken; to go from the altar
of Jehovah to the Temple of Rimmon; to turn from
the true God to the false; to have none to show them
a better way! Nay, thou couldst not be reconciled to
dwell in this heathen land.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some reason Miriam resented his half-pitying,
half-complacent tone. The quiet which had possessed
her since the tearful farewells at Naaman&#8217;s
gate suddenly forsook her. &#8220;The daybreak, Eli,
how cometh it, suddenly and with the noise of a
trumpet or silently and by degrees, one faint radiance
succeeding another until all is light?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a moment before he caught her meaning.
&#8220;Yea, I see,&#8221; he said, glowing with admiration, &#8220;and
<i>thou</i> hast led this household to its first, faint gleam&mdash;the
gleam which shineth more and more unto the
perfect daybreak.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the most splendid house of the &#8220;city&#8221; of Hannathon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the house with the courtyard which Judith
had so coveted, Abner addressed her, a little frown
on his forehead:</p>

<p>&#8220;One field after another have I added to what I
already had. Anxious enough were our neighbors
to sell and remove hence when the Syrian raid left
them hungry and desolate and afraid. For almost
nothing did many part with their possessions. And
now the best vineyard of them all, that held by
Sarah, widow of Caleb, I cannot buy because thou
dost withhold the pearl which I might offer as surety
for payment in full when the grapes be gathered in
the fall. So obstinate is a woman! Long hath
Sarah held the land and offer after offer hath she
refused, saying the vineyard be all of her living save
a few olive trees. Now, with Eli gone, a price hath
been agreed upon, but she demanded of me a pledge.
Come, give me the pearl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith&#8217;s eyes besought him piteously. &#8220;I cannot,&#8221;
she faltered.</p>

<p>He smiled unpleasantly, quite misunderstanding
the reason for her hesitancy. &#8220;Because it is Sarah,
who hath shared her home with thee? Because she
is old before her time and sick? Because thou
thinkest I offer her too little? Five years ago thou
wert ready to leave her roof for mine. Hath she
treated thee better than I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Judith&#8217;s eyes spoke, this time with a flash
of indignation. &#8220;Never hath she treated me well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Grudgingly always did she offer me a home. Daughter
that I have been to her for the past five years
since Miriam was taken away, never doth she look
<i>at</i> me but always <i>through</i> me. My services are acceptable
but not myself. Never doth she let me forget
that I am of strange people. It was Caleb, husband
of Sarah and brother to my father, who was
ever my friend.&#8221; Her voice broke, but in a moment
she went on more steadily: &#8220;What I do for
her is in memory of him and of the little maid who
loved me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he declared, his eyebrows drawn together
until they made one line: &#8220;So it is because I
refused help to that visionary, Eli, who desired a
gift toward the maid&#8217;s ransom, that thou dost revenge
thyself upon me by withholding the pearl. As
if he would find trace of her! As if he would want
to find what he would find! Thinkest thou a little
maid would be safe in the midst of a rough soldiery?
Thinkest thou the cruel Syrians would deal gently
with a child? Nay, but when Eli returneth with a
tale too pitiful to tell a sorrowing mother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith interrupted, her words coming chokingly:
&#8220;When Eli failed to secure thy help, I besought thine
aid for Miriam, adding my tears to his, thinking
thou wouldst understand and sympathize, thou, a
sorrowing father, who had himself lost a little maid,
a maid so tiny and so sweet, stolen by Death, not
by the Syrians&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>She turned her head and a sob escaped her. There
was absolute silence in the apartment. Abner
cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou dost evade the question. Come, acknowledge
the truth. Thou dost revenge thyself upon me
by withholding the pearl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; returned Judith, &#8220;I would scorn to avenge
myself upon thee. I&mdash;I&mdash;have lost the pearl.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I feared to tell thee lest thou be angry,&#8221;
she added, not looking at him.</p>

<p>He strode across the room and took her face between
his hands, striving to read her expression.
Something he saw there dictated his next words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless it had been stolen from thee, small chance
hast thou had to lose it. Nay, but thou dost deceive
me. Speak without fear. What hast thou done with
the jewel?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. &#8220;I lost it,&#8221; she reiterated.</p>

<p>Storm clouds gathered on his face and the tempest
broke in fury upon her: &#8220;Thinkest thou to deal
doubly with me and yet find confidence and affection?
Nay, but truth will I have from thee, else this
home is no longer thine. Speak! What hast thou
done with the pearl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith meditated. To confess while he was in
that mood was to find neither understanding nor
approval. She would wait until his heart was more
tender toward her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;I have lost it,&#8221; she repeated, sullenly, and cowered
as he came toward her.</p>

<p>Laying a rough hand on her shoulder he pointed
to the door: &#8220;Go thou and enter not again until
truth be thy companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shaking off his hand she faced him. Not a word
did she utter, but the look he never forgot. In a
moment she had passed out of the door into the sun-kissed
air, divorced by the one word which an Oriental
husband may speak at any time to the wife of
whom he has tired, and which even a Jew occasionally
spoke in defiance of Mosaic law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the top of the hill which crowned the Valley
of Jiptha-el, a woman bent and worn sat patiently
on the coarse green grass under the shade of a wild
fig tree. As Judith appeared she addressed her
without salutation and without taking her eyes from
the path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Day after day, from sunrise to sunset, have I
stayed here, waiting for Eli to bring them back to
me. Yet if they were coming, would they not have
been here a month ago? Early were the rains over
and long hath travelers been passing the mouth of
the valley, but they for whom I wait come not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice had in it that note of calm endurance
which belongs to those who have suffered. Judith,
observing her in the strong sunlight, thought she
had never looked so frail.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;To-day and to-morrow and the day after will
I wait,&#8221; went on Sarah, &#8220;and then&mdash;&#8221; she put her
hand over her heart&mdash;&#8220;then if they come not, I will
know he hath not found them and I think I cannot
wait longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith was startled out of her own sad musings.
&#8220;It is the first time I have heard thee hint at surrender,&#8221;
she said, reproachfully. &#8220;Nay, but be of
good courage. What if they should come later?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they come after I am gone,&#8221; was the answer,
the worn hand still over the tired heart, &#8220;tell them I
waited as long as I could, as long as the pain would
let me. Tell Eli that I say his faithfulness hath
never let me feel the lack of a son, and tell Miriam
that no one could take her place, but that thou, like
a dear, elder daughter, hath filled a corner in my
heart all thine own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith stared incredulously. &#8220;Thou canst not
mean&mdash;&#8221; she began, but Sarah went on, unheeding
the interruption:</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange that the maiden I could not welcome
should have been my stay and comfort these five
years and more! And tell Benjamin, my beloved&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith brushed away the tears: &#8220;Oh but thou
dost not know the wrong&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah was shading her eyes with her hand:
&#8220;What meaneth that cloud of dust in the valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheep,&#8221; declared Judith with a careless glance.
&#8220;Why, if I had ever known that thou hast even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
thought of me kindly&mdash;and thou couldst not if thou
knewest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A flock of sheep larger, yea, twice as large as
Benjamin tended,&#8221; commented Sarah. &#8220;See, the
shepherd turneth them aside into the old sheepfold
which hath not seen the like since the Syrians
swooped down upon us so long ago. And a band of
horsemen and a chariot! Thinkest thou the king&#8217;s
messengers come this way? But why the flock
escorted by soldiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned a wondering face toward Judith, but
her question was answered when a tall youth and a
maiden, the first of the party to reach the top of
the hill, paused to take breath after the steep climb.
With true Eastern hospitality Sarah rose and tottered
feebly toward them. A moment more and Eli&#8217;s voice
sounded in her ears and Miriam&#8217;s arms were around
her. Another moment and Benjamin was bending
over her. She looked in bewildered fashion from
one to the other as if scarce comprehending. At
last she smiled upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith,&#8221; she called, &#8220;Judith, come thou. My
children must be all together,&#8221; and closed her eyes
with a little sigh of contentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Rachel must be here also,&#8221; said Benjamin,
drawing her toward him as she held the babe.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Nathan too,&#8221; put in Eli, taking his brother
by the arm.</p>

<p>Among them all they carried Sarah to her old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
home and, without one backward glance, the happy,
chattering group entered, leaving a lone figure upon
the hilltop.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight to be seen in Israel, that
soldier in splendid Syrian dress, lingering there.
He noted the village straggling up the unpaved
street, the tender green of growing things in the
valley beneath, the low cloud of dust hovering over
the sheepfold. Memory was likewise busy. He
recalled Miriam&#8217;s joy in Eli&#8217;s coming to Damascus,
her unwonted gayety since they had started for the
Land of Israel, her present absorption in her
mother. Yet could aught else be expected? Reasoning
with himself, excusing her, striving to stifle the
pain of her thoughtlessness, he descended the hill
to the encampment of the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea,&#8221; he said mournfully to himself, &#8220;we have
lost our little maid,&#8221; and then, again, with heart-sick
despair, &#8220;<i>I</i> have lost <i>my</i> little maid.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


WAITING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the House of Abner the usual household scenes
mocked the sorrowing man who beheld them.
&#8220;Empty, empty, empty!&#8221; he moaned. &#8220;My Rose of
Sharon have I plucked from its stem and cast aside.
Ah, woe is my portion!&#8221;</p>

<p>Striding down the village street long before the
morning mists had faded, he paused in front of
Sarah&#8217;s house, thereby startling a beautiful girl in
foreign raiment who had just stepped over the
threshold and surprising himself scarcely less. Then
he recalled the conversation of his excited servants
the day before, tidings which had been unheeded in
his own grief. This must be Miriam!</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; she replied to his question, &#8220;my mother
and I are quite alone. Very early this morning did
Benjamin take Rachel and their little son to the
house of her parents, whom she saw but briefly yesterday.
Eli and Nathan soon afterward took the
path down the hill to the camp of the soldiers, and
Judith departed likewise. Nay, I know not where.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was hastening away when she ran and prostrated
herself in his path. &#8220;My lord hath been good
to his servant. I thank thee for the pearl which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
thou didst send to Syria by the hand of Eli for my
ransom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abner listened dully. &#8220;A pearl, thou sayest?&#8221;
And then the significance of her speech dawned upon
him. &#8220;Rise thou,&#8221; he commanded, suavely, &#8220;it was
but a small gift. Happy am I that it hath helped to
purchase thy freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tenderly reminiscent smile played around
Miriam&#8217;s mouth. &#8220;Nay,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have returned
to Israel because of a jewel more precious than any
found in earth or sea: the love of my master and
mistress. Naught would they accept but gave me
freedom and sent me to my mother with a gift in
mine hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the pearl,&#8221; inquired Abner, eagerly. &#8220;What
hath become of the jewel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eli hath already given it back to Judith, from
whom he received it,&#8221; she answered, and with cool
adieux turned and left him.</p>

<p>He passed a hand over his brow, made as if to
turn back, hesitated and then went on, groping his
way down the hill and through the fields, wet with
the night dews. The camp of the soldiers, so busy
a scene at sunset, was now deserted, and huddled
over the still warm ashes of what had recently been
a fire was the figure he sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;arrived&mdash;too&mdash;late. They&mdash;were&mdash;already&mdash;gone,&#8221;
she said, slowly, in response to his excited
inquiry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Abner laid a shaking hand upon her shoulder. A
crimson flush crept into the pale cheek. Rising suddenly
she wrenched herself from his grasp and
thrust something into his hand. &#8220;Take it,&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I should have known thou wouldst have followed
me even to Damascus to get it back. Lo, thou hast
that which thou seekest,&#8221; and turning, she fled.</p>

<p>He glanced hastily at the object she had given
him. It was the pearl. With sudden passion he
threw it into the unsearchable depths of the canyon
and swiftly followed Judith, but a loose stone ended
the pursuit. With a cry of pain she stumbled and
fell, and when he bent over the prostrate figure a
moment later her eyes were closed. It was Eli who
answered Abner&#8217;s hail and helped him carry his burden
up the hill. Stopping for a moment&#8217;s rest they
met Miriam on her way to the spring.</p>

<p>With anxious questions and practical sympathy
the girl knelt beside her cousin, slipping off the sandal
and examining the rapidly swelling ankle.
&#8220;Straight to my mother&#8217;s house,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;It is so near,&#8221; but Abner objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;To her own home,&#8221; he commanded, sharply,
preparing to resume his load.</p>

<p>Judith&#8217;s eyes flew open. &#8220;Nay,&#8221; she protested
feebly. &#8220;Thou shouldst know that truth is not my
companion nor hath ever been. I stole the pearl.
It is that for which Caleb, brother to my father, was
slain, and which Sarah, who hath been a mother to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
me, cast away in her despair. I found it and used it
to serve my own ends. Then, when it had long been
a coal of fire in my bosom I gave it to Eli to help
with the little maid&#8217;s ransom. Yet sin reapeth sorrow
as surely as harvest followeth the time of sowing.
Because of the pearl my husband hath divorced me,
and lest my disgrace be known to those to whom it
would bring grief, I determined to use the jewel to
purchase my way to Damascus with the soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam&#8217;s amazed look encountered Eli&#8217;s stern one.
&#8220;I knew not,&#8221; he began, but Miriam was stroking
Judith&#8217;s forehead and speaking tenderly. &#8220;Always
hast thou been unhappy in Hannathon, for wast not
thy sadness mine? Yea, but come thou. Behold,
our home is thine also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Abner with decision, &#8220;we take thee
to thine own house, thine and mine. As for the
pearl, I knew not it belonged to Sarah. I hated it
for the trouble it hath caused thee and me and just
now I flung it into the gorge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli gasped. &#8220;But thou wilt pay,&#8221; he insisted.
&#8220;Its value shalt thou redeem, that the widow and
the orphan be not robbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was quite as decided. &#8220;Nay, it hath
ever been an evil thing, and with the gift sent by
Naaman my master, my mother will not miss the
pearl. Rather would she wish it counted dead now
that it hath been buried. Her anxiety will be for
Judith. Take her to our house, I pray thee.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>But he would not and the little procession resumed
its slow march to his abode.</p>

<p>An hour later Miriam remembered the abandoned
water jar, and bidding her cousin an affectionate
farewell, hastened to reclaim her forgotten property.
The sun had finally conquered the fog and
sweet-scented breezes played with her hair, but the
sight of Eli, dolorously gazing into the distance,
hushed the song in her heart.</p>

<p>He broke the news without preamble. &#8220;Nathan
hath returned to Damascus with the soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The water jar came near crashing to the earth in
Miriam&#8217;s consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oft have we talked of our future plans now that
thou art provided for,&#8221; went on Eli, sure of understanding,
&#8220;but only this morning, when we visited
the camp, did he tell me of his resolve. Then I
could not say him nay, knowing that here he must
work for Abner, whom we like not, and I was the
more persuaded when Isaac, chief of the band which
brought us on our way, promised to be surety for
the lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam was staring wild-eyed into the valley at
their feet. &#8220;Gone, thou sayest? The soldiers gone?
And Isaac came not to my mother&#8217;s house, came not
to tell me that he goeth&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli nodded impatiently. &#8220;Thinkest thou he would
have said more to thee than to me? A likable young
man and one in whom remorse hath kindled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
fires of penitence which alone purifieth. He hath
restored thee to the home from which thou wert
stolen, and he saith that when the rains are over and
the roads passable once more he will return to see
if thou dost wish to go back to Damascus. As if
thou wouldst again be bound by the cords of
bondage!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miriam was half-way down the hill, sobbing
bitterly, leaving Eli to gaze after her in great and
growing bewilderment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same sun which had kissed into bloom the
wild flowers of Israel shone with dazzling brightness
upon the white walls of Damascus, warming youth
into gayety and age into contentment, but its rays
were futile to coax into cheerfulness the great House
of Naaman. There was an inexplicable sense of loss.
The maid servants grumbled among themselves at
the uncertainty of Milcah&#8217;s temper and longed for
Miriam, their ever-sympathetic mediator. The men
servants hoped they would see her bright face again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that she ever had much to say,&#8221; explained
the old gatekeeper, &#8220;and few were the smiles she had
for the young men, as most maids have, but the lowest
servant and the grandest visitor were alike to
her. Well do I remember&mdash;&#8221; and the garrulous
tongue would run on as long as it had an audience.</p>

<p>Nor were the servants the only ones who missed
Miriam. With light fingers Adah smoothed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
creases from between her brows. &#8220;The maid servants
drive me frantic,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;&#8216;Do I want
this?&#8217; and &#8216;how will I have that?&#8217; The little maid
would have known without asking and seen that it
was done without confusion. My heart yearneth
over the maiden.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier standing respectfully on the other side
of the room nodded. &#8220;The young man Eli, to whom
I talked long, saith that the mother faileth fast.
Peradventure Miriam will be free to return to Syria
if she so desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah&#8217;s irritation increased. &#8220;The young man Eli!
Admire him I must, but like him I cannot, for would
he not rob thy master and me of the sunbeam which
hath gladdened our hearts&mdash;the little maid we have
come to love as a daughter? Nay, but not for
always. One year, Isaac, shalt thou remain in Syria,
then shalt thou return to Israel with a gift in thine
hand, bringing Miriam and her mother gently and
by slow degrees if the woman be feeble. Here shall
the household delight to do her honor. One year,
Isaac, from the time our little maid went away shall
she come back to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this decree of its mistress, the House of
Naaman entered, with what patience it could, upon
its period of waiting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Miriam did <i>not</i> return at the end of a year.
The wild flowers faded in Israel; the figs ripened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
and were gone; the hills grew bare and yellow under
the sun&#8217;s persistent glare; the grapes turned dusky
and filled with liquid sweetness; the olive trees blossomed
and bore and were denuded; the rains came
and went; barley and wheat were sowed and matured
and were harvested and wild flowers bloomed
a second time in Israel. It was another spring, the
time Isaac had said he would come, but though
Miriam strained her eyes day after day gazing afar,
no foreign horsemen, no chariot, no Syrian camels
bestirred the dust of the Valley of Jiptha-el.</p>

<p>Rachel touched her lightly on the shoulder as she
stood in the doorway. There was yearning tenderness
in the older woman&#8217;s tones: &#8220;Still waitest
thou, little maid? Peradventure they think thy
mother hath need of thee, knowing not that she
sleepeth long months in the sepulcher of thy people.
Ample time hath there been since the rains ceased to
take even the long journey from Damascus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam turned a musing countenance. &#8220;But when
Isaac talked last with Eli he said he would return
when the rains were over to see how it fareth with
me and to bring me tidings of my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel sighed and drew the girl close. &#8220;Is not
thy mother&#8217;s dwelling &#8216;home&#8217;? And behold how
Benjamin and little Caleb and I have loved thee.
Are we not dearer than any in the House of Naaman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam smiled and returned the caress. &#8220;The love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
light in thine eyes is beautiful and it filleth me with
delight when it shineth upon me, but mostly doth it
shine for thy husband and babe and for joy in thy
home, not for thy sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the way with a woman,&#8221; was the answer,
&#8220;as some day thou wilt know for thyself, for I have
seen a look in eyes that followed thee, such a look
as a man giveth to but one maid, though peradventure
thou knowest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, but as there was no reply and
Miriam&#8217;s face was turned away, she hurried on:
&#8220;And so thou wilt soon have a home of thine own
if that is what thou desirest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam at last found voice: &#8220;&#8216;Home&#8217; is where
thou art needed, Rachel, where thou hast a place no
other can fill. Here in Israel, now that my mother
hath left me&mdash;&#8221; there was a choking pause&mdash;&#8220;I am
not necessary as I am to the household in Syria.
Milcah groweth feeble in body and impatient in
mind. The maid servants resent her sharpness, and
my mistress is distressed when things go not well.
But most of all do they need help to walk in the way
of Jehovah, for him only do they serve since the
healing of my master at his word. So do I wait until
my mistress sendeth. Nay,&#8221; as Rachel affectionately
protested, &#8220;nay, I shall not be disappointed,
for did not Isaac say he would come?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so she waited. Again the wild flowers faded
and the figs ripened and the hills grew sere and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
brown. It was midsummer. This time a pilgrim
approached Hannathon, but he was alone and on
foot, taking the steep hills and fertile vales with an
easy, swinging stride as none but a Highlander, born
and bred, could have taken them. From the flat
roof where she was spreading linen to dry, Miriam
saw him while yet a great way off and called to Rachel
exultantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eli cometh.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not go to meet him. Instead, she hastily
descended the stairs and retreated within the house,
excitement in her manner and an unwonted color in
her cheeks. When he entered, though they spoke
only commonplaces, neither of them observed that
Rachel took the child and slipped quietly out of the
house with a smiling glance backward. Quite absorbed
in each other, they sat on one of the low
benches which lined three sides of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two years hath it been, Miriam, since I joined
myself to the young men, the Sons of the Prophet.
Two full years have I hung upon the words of our
great master, Elisha, learning much concerning our
Law and its interpretation, and things of lesser importance
such as music and sacred poetry. Thinkest
thou not my mother would be pleased to know that
I am of this company, even as was my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s face was glowing with enthusiasm. &#8220;It
is as thou and I have dreamed from childhood, Eli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little while shall I spend with thee and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Benjamin, for I have a mind to learn the care of a
flock. Then, with the treasure not needed for thy
ransom will I purchase sheep and goats, which will
supply my living while I preach the word of Jehovah
to this froward people. Beyond that thou
knowest&mdash;thou must know&mdash;my heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand in his and although it trembled
slightly it was not withdrawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there will be no objection from thy
brother, for long hath he known me, so I shall speak
to him in due time without dread, but concerned am
I to know if thou wouldst be satisfied so to spend
thy life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face paled under his anxious scrutiny, &#8220;Nay,
I could not,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>He was silent a long moment, and when he spoke
his voice betrayed profound sorrow. &#8220;It is even as
I feared. In Damascus, where thy impressionable
years were spent, thou hast learned the luxury which
belongeth alone to kings&#8217; courts. Thou wouldst
not be willing to toil as do the women of Israel,
where there is neither man servant nor maid servant.
Have I not been in Syria and do I not know how
different are the ways there and here?&#8221;</p>

<p>She disengaged her hand and faced him earnestly:
&#8220;Not because of its riches, Eli, must I return to the
House of Naaman, but because of its poverty. Except
through me they know not Jehovah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And except we of prophetic vision teach him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Israel, the people are altogether turned unto idols,&#8221;
he answered, in his eyes the fanatical gleam of the
zealot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, but there be many Sons of the Prophet in
Israel. There be none in Syria. Save as tidings of
the healing of my master hath been scattered abroad
and praise given to the God by whose hand it was
performed, none knoweth Jehovah. He is merely
the God of Israel, their sometimes-enemies in the
south, and Rimmon and Baal and a host of others
are more real to them. Come thou with me to Damascus,
where thou art needed, and instead of a
shepherd, thou shalt be a scribe, and being diligent
in the business of Naaman, thou shalt also instruct
the household and preach the word of the Lord to
those who know it not otherwise. Say thou wilt
come,&#8221; she pleaded, but he only gazed at her pityingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray thee, Miriam, deceive not thyself. For
more than a year hast thou waited for a messenger
from Syria and grown pale and thin with disappointment.
Rachel hath told me, and have I not seen
for myself when I came to visit thee? Nay, for if
one were coming, there hath been time and to spare.&#8221;
His brow clouded. &#8220;Yet had I hoped to hear from
Nathan through that same messenger. Both thou
and I didst trust the soldier, and thou more than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color sprang again to Miriam&#8217;s cheek. &#8220;My
trust will not be in vain,&#8221; she declared, quietly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
&#8220;Something of ill hath happened in Damascus, else
my mistress would have sent, but Isaac will yet
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by Rachel&#8217;s
entrance, and Miriam, making an excuse of the linen
on the roof, ran quickly up the stairs to a task which
consumed a vast amount of time even in the leisurely
East, where time counted for little.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


ANTICIPATION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> again Isaac stood before Adah, mistress
of the House of Naaman. He bowed low. &#8220;Everything
is in readiness for our departure to Israel. The
caravan waiteth without the gate and the maid servants
thou art sending to attend upon Miriam are at
hand, but lest thou shouldst have some last instructions
for thy servant&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah briefly acknowledged the courtesy and the
courtier. She was thinner than of old, there was
more of gray in her hair and the lines were deeper
between her eyes. Now she rested her head upon
her hand in the languor so becoming and so habitual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that thou shouldst bring the maid and her
mother,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;with any others she may
not care to leave behind. If she will but come, for
she is free to choose, as thou knowest! Thou takest
a present in thine hand. Bring the maid safely, but
in haste, for she is dear unto me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The messenger bowed his understanding of his
orders, but the lady was not through with the conference.
She continued, musingly: &#8220;Two years
since she left us, Isaac, and one since we had confidently
planned for her return. It hath been a long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
long year, full of alarm and anxiety for us and of
waiting for her. <i>If</i> she hath waited! Miriam is
now at an age when maidens dream romantic, vagrant
dreams of mating. Oft in the night seasons
have I lain awake wondering if, in despair of a
Syrian messenger, she hath betrothed herself or possibly
married&#8221;&mdash;the speaker shuddered&mdash;&#8220;some Israelitish
youth who would not be at home in Damascus
or the House of Naaman. As thou knowest,
Syrian ways are more gentle and their speech less
rough than those of Israel.&#8221; She paused, evidently
expecting some comforting assurance that her fears
were not, could not, be true.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the tones of love are as soft in one tongue
as in another, and when interpreted to a maiden&#8217;s
willing heart they are softer still,&#8221; he said, gently.</p>

<p>She was exasperated at his answer, not knowing
what it had cost him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miriam gave promise of beauty,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;and Syrian lovers will she have in plenty, especially
when it is known that the favor of the House
of Naaman goeth with her. Already one, hoping
to be the first, hath asked her of me in marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The start which Isaac gave was not lost upon
Adah, but she affected blindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou knowest him well. It is thy friend,
Lemuel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young soldier was visibly agitated. He prostrated
himself before Adah, entreating her attention:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
&#8220;And if thy servant hath found favor in thy
sight grant that this sacrifice shall not be. Always
hath the maid feared and hated the man and with
good cause, as we who know him can testify.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated before making a second request:
&#8220;No man liveth who is good enough for her, but almost
am I persuaded that she would rather be given
into my care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah repressed a smile. &#8220;I shall give Miriam to
someone more to my liking and to hers than is
Lemuel, but I had not supposed thou wouldst have
taken advantage of the maid&#8217;s childish expressions
of fondness for thee to weave into them meanings
she could not then understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac&#8217;s cheek flushed under his soldier tan. &#8220;I
have not, my mistress, and I would not. A thousand
times hath she innocently told me that which I long
to hear her say with full knowledge of its import.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner changed to sadness. &#8220;Yet do I know
that always she hath carried in her heart the image
of Eli, and that she was greatly touched by his desire
to ransom her from what he supposed was cruel
slavery. He hath the soul of a saint and the mind
of a seer, while thy servant is naught but a soldier.
I fear that when I reach Hannathon it will be to find
her choice hath already been made and needeth but
thine approval.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah frowned. &#8220;Thy master&#8217;s plans cannot be
lightly changed. This is a childless home and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
treasure is great. We are not unmindful of the two
through whose loving devotion much of its happiness
hath come. Already hath thy master divided
between thee and Miriam the present which the
prophet of Israel refused, and seeing thy tender affection
each for the other, we have determined that
when the maid is old enough she shall be given
thee in marriage. Thus shall the joy and contentment
of both be assured, and thou shalt be unto us
in our age and helplessness as the pillars are to the
temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid servant who was fanning her mistress
gasped audibly, for which indecorum the sorely displeased
Adah sent her hastily and in disgrace from
the room, but the punishment rested lightly. Once
outside the angle of vision of those within, feet and
tongue were nimble in disseminating this surprising
bit of news. Only Milcah, exacting and irritable,
did the excited servants fear to approach. The tidings
spread, however, not only within the gate but
without, and provided a choice bit of gossip for the
caravan, impatiently awaiting its leader. Two of
the company failed to receive the message with the
laughing approval of the others: over the sensitive
face of a boy passed a look of surprise, and the man
next to him smiled an evil smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Isaac had stammered his thanks and
had again become a suppliant: &#8220;But if it please
not the maid, my mistress, I pray thee to entreat thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
husband that he transfer his favor to the young
man Eli. I think there can be no other in Miriam&#8217;s
thoughts. Thou wilt find him worthy, and in the
maiden&#8217;s joy thou shalt have thy reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adah was frankly amused. &#8220;Thou dost plead
well to be released. Peradventure some other
maiden&mdash;&#8221; but the look on his face checked the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for admiration of Eli do I speak, but for love
of Miriam,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;The circumstances in
which I would have brought another maiden to the
House of Naaman could not be justified in the pure
eyes of my little maid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then am I sure that thy master&#8217;s confidence hath
not been misplaced,&#8221; she answered, softly, &#8220;and a
maiden&#8217;s unruly heart is not always wise. Nevertheless,
do thou bring the young man if it seemeth
right unto thee. I trust to thy discretion, and when I
have had time to talk to Miriam and to observe for
myself, I shall be better able to judge what is best.
Only go thou quickly and delay not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left alone, Adah laughed quietly to herself. &#8220;If
Miriam had the eyes of experience, she would prefer
the good-looking young soldier who loveth her unselfishly
to the gifted young fanatic who loveth an
ideal more than any maid. I shall not compel her
choice, but her master will like not the idea of sharing
the treasure of the House of Naaman with a
stranger.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>Quite unexpectedly Milcah bent over her, having
entered the apartment unobserved while her mistress
mused. &#8220;Didst thou wish something? I
thought I heard thee speak. That worthless maid
I sent in here an hour ago hath not wit to do aught
save curl her hair and make eyes at the men servants.&#8221;
The woman wiped away a tear and continued,
speaking unsteadily: &#8220;The caravan hath just
started. Many a time have I seen my brother ride
to war and cared less, but to-day it seemeth so joyful
it is almost solemn.&#8221;</p>

<p>All at once the peace-loving Adah felt a vague uneasiness,
dreading the unpleasantness of Milcah&#8217;s
disapproval. Clearly she had a duty of preparation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if Isaac should ever think of marrying&mdash;&#8221;
she began, but only to be promptly and tearfully
interrupted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say not so, for I should hate his wife. Never a
maid have I seen save our little Miriam that I could
regard with sisterly affection, and he would never
think of the child <i>that</i> way.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Up the Valley of Jiptha-el in the heat of midsummer
dashed a lone horseman. No anxious watcher
from the roof heralded his approach, but every echo
sought to imitate his wild shouts. The village was
surprised, alarmed, but comforted when the horseman
was discovered to be Nathan&mdash;reckless, jubilant,
noisy, the veteran of one war and a braggart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
In a single breath he poured out greetings, exclamations,
comments and all the gossip of Damascus.</p>

<p>Isaac was coming, but just this side of the Jordan
he had been obliged to make camp with a sick soldier,
Lemuel by name, so he (Nathan), unable to wait,
had pushed on alone. Danger there was (his manner
became very self-important), but what of that
to one who had faced the hordes of the desert? Last
year when the fruit trees first blossomed around
Damascus, its peace and prosperity had been threatened
by the half-wild tribes who roamed the desert
to the east; beautiful, rich, lonely Damascus, whose
stoutest walls were her walls of living men, her
soldiery! But it had held, thanks to Naaman, Captain
of the Host, who was respected and adored as
no other man in the city.</p>

<p>It was the younger men who had showed most
valor. Once he (Nathan) had been surrounded by
five dark-skinned, savage enemies. Making ready
his sling he was taking aim and would have slain
them all had not Isaac and his servant interfered.
He bore them no malice, but when Isaac realized
that they had not been needed he had given him a
horse all his own. Fine horse it was with dainty
feet and fiery spirit, Isaac&#8217;s share of the spoils of
battle, but he would probably never miss it. Everybody
knew he stood high in favor with the House of
Naaman. He might in time be chief steward and
rich.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>This spring not a desert chieftain had dared even
to gaze upon Damascus, but there were rumors that
the Assyrian hosts came nearer and nearer. Not
a soldier was allowed to leave the city. Day and
night a watch had been maintained and every fighting
man stood ready, but the Assyrians tarried.
Pity, too! It would have been glorious to engage in
battle with the finest army in the world. But no
enemies having appeared by midsummer and scouting
parties reporting the danger past for a time at
least, Isaac had been allowed to take a small band
into Israel to render the journey to Syria safe for
Miriam. No doubt he would wish to hurry back,
for was he not going to be married? The tidings
had been scattered abroad the morning they had
started. Nay, he knew nothing more.</p>

<p>All at once Nathan realized that his speech had
been undiplomatic, and hastily turned his attention
to Hannathon. Eli was taller and thinner than ever.
He ought to be a soldier and properly fed. A good
fighter he would make too. Miriam had become
amazingly pretty. If she found there was no one to
marry her, he would be willing. She looked something
like Rachel did before she faded out so. How
was Benjamin? He would ride out to find him after
a while, for would he not want to see the horse? And
how the little boy had grown! Who would have
supposed that such a sturdy, bright-looking youngster
could have developed from that ugly, stupid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
baby? The village was just the same; very unexciting
after Damascus. The only new thing was the
house. So the old was not good enough, and they
had built one like those in Syria! Well, they were
more comfortable. How sad that Sarah had not
liked it! She might have lived longer if she had not
been obliged to change her ways to suit those who
had learned better.</p>

<p>But Eli must come and look at the horse he had
left at the foot of the hill. He knew his master and
he had a trick&mdash; Still talking, Nathan descended
the path with Eli while Rachel and Miriam returned
to their grinding at the mill, Rachel smiling and chatting,
but Miriam strangely unresponsive. And once
again a shadow darkened the doorway. With respectful
salutations Lemuel stood upon the threshold,
seeming not to be affected by the frigid greeting he
received. He had merely pushed on ahead of the
party, he said, desiring earnestly to see the maid
whom he had missed sadly. Her mistress would explain
why he felt he had a right to do this. (Miriam
shrank from his bold gaze.)</p>

<p>Isaac came more slowly, seeming, in fact, to be
in no haste to arrive. When he <i>did</i> come he would
have news. Rumor said he was soon to be married,
but since he refused to talk on the subject it was
taken to mean that the matter had been arranged by
his master&#8217;s decree rather than his own preference.
Not even the name of the maid was known, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
was further evidence that he was not proud of her.
It was not unlikely that his choice centered elsewhere,
but that might all be gossip. Certainly, it
was beneath a man&#8217;s honor to bear tales of his
friend, and he and Isaac had long been comrades.
Well, Isaac was handsome and in favor with the rich
and powerful House of Naaman, so maids there
were in plenty who would be glad to unite their fortunes
with his.</p>

<p>The speaker may have felt the chill with which his
tidings were received or his errand may have been
finished. At all events he took his departure. Rachel
watched him from the door, shivering the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sweep the house,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;I feel
as if a serpent had uncoiled itself in our midst,&#8221; but
Miriam said nothing at all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Screened from observation by the bushes down in
the gorge, Lemuel examined a wounded foot.
&#8220;Cursed be those thorns,&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;but it is
worth it even though I had to leave my horse. Lucky
that I remembered the cross-cuts of our scouting
days in Israel! It hath helped me to repay Isaac for
many long-cherished grudges.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the sun and uttered an exclamation.
&#8220;I had better be on my way to Damascus by the time
he findeth that I have tricked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near at hand an animal whinnied and Lemuel&#8217;s
eyes brightened. A few moments later, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
path led into the valley road, a horse and its rider
dodged quickly behind a clump of trees to avoid being
seen by a caravan at the head of which rode
Isaac, and that afternoon Nathan searched sorrowfully
but in vain for his steed of the desert.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />


CERTAINTY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A trifle</span> shyly Miriam stood in the doorway
awaiting Isaac, who was coming alone up the hill.
One look into his face as he came nearer, with eyes
only for her, and both her hands were outstretched,
but Eli pushed past her, speaking low:</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray thee, Miriam, let us greet the man with
becoming dignity. Behold, have I not been as a son
in thy mother&#8217;s household and in Benjamin&#8217;s absence
is it not my place to welcome its guests?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed happily. &#8220;Why, it is only Isaac.
He would think it strange if I delayed to meet him
and I am so glad, so very glad, he hath come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he may misunderstand thy eagerness,
Miriam.&#8221; Eli&#8217;s tones were somewhat stern. &#8220;Remember,
thou art no longer a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam stopped short, reddening painfully.
&#8220;Isaac hath never misunderstood,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when he took both her hands in his
she was for the first time unable to meet his gaze
frankly. He found it very charming and in some
circumstances it might have been encouraging, but
he had seen, if he had not heard, and now put his
own construction upon the degree of understanding
between herself and Eli. With a heavy heart he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
noticed that Eli acted as host, a right not only undisputed
but apparently expected by both Rachel and
Miriam. From this he drew further disquieting conclusions,
which were not contradicted by the conversation
he was allowed with Miriam herself.</p>

<p>She asked innumerable questions about the household
at Damascus, but there was not half time to answer
fully. She told him a great deal about her
mother&#8217;s last days and very little about herself. Far
too little to satisfy him. She called his attention to
the new abode, built on the site of the old with the
gift she had brought from the House of Naaman.
Her mother had never found the dwelling comfortable.
It had seemed too luxurious to have those low
and wide benches on three sides of the room for
sitting and sleeping, and she was uneasy about the
animals, banished to quarters in the courtyard. She
had felt more secure to have them at night on the
unfloored portion of the same apartment. But the
new house was much prized by Benjamin and Rachel,
and since they preferred to remain in Israel to
be the stay and consolation of Rachel&#8217;s parents,
Miriam was glad they would have the comfort of a
home like those in Syria.</p>

<p>The gift Isaac had just brought&mdash;such a generous
present from her beloved master and mistress&mdash;should
be used to purchase a larger flock for Benjamin
and thus secure a greater income. Then she
spoke of her plans for Eli (she and Isaac were alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
for a few minutes), plans which he heartily approved
because it would please her. She talked with a pretty
hesitancy and with such an evident gratitude and admiration
for Eli that Isaac&#8217;s worst fears were confirmed,
yet he could not bring himself to ask a question
direct. He would wait a few days and observe
for himself, and he was comforted to an extent by
the fact that she desired to return to Damascus. He
had hardly expected such willingness.</p>

<p>Finally, Isaac and Eli and Rachel and Miriam together
decided that the journey to Syria should not
be undertaken for a week. Isaac particularly wished
to see Benjamin, and a week would give Miriam time
to say her farewells without haste. Also the soldiers
would be grateful for a rest in the shade of the
mountains. The midsummer heat of the roads they
must travel was anything but pleasant, but circumstances
had granted them no choice. As Miriam
watched him depart, the virus of Lemuel&#8217;s remarks
began to be active in her brain. Isaac was evidently
not in any hurry to return to Damascus!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the morning of Miriam&#8217;s departure and
she and Rachel, from the doorway, were watching
the sun rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art so pale, Miriam. Thou dost not have to
go. Hast not thy generous master freed thee? I
shall miss thee every day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;And every day will I think of thee, Rachel, and
of Benjamin and little Caleb, and wish we could all
be in the same country rather than separated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am better satisfied to know that Isaac is
going to be married,&#8221; went on the older woman.
&#8220;His wife will be like a sister, taking my place to
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;Miriam,&#8221; with a bewildered little
laugh, &#8220;wouldst thou have me think&mdash;why, art thou
not glad, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; answered the girl, &#8220;I like not to dwell
upon the thought. Have I not always been first to
him, next after his duty to his master? And now
how greatly is he changed! A week hath passed and
he hath never mentioned the maiden&#8217;s name nor even
told me he is to be married. If it be thus now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel was aghast. Her tones were pityingly
severe: &#8220;Thou hast no mother, Miriam, and I must
speak plainly for thine own good. Isaac took thee
into captivity out of no malice. Thou wert one
of the spoils of war. Afterward, when he knew
thou wert sister to Benjamin, the man who had befriended
him, he was sorry and tried to be kind, but
remorse is not love. Thou must not expect it of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl turned a face as pink as the sky. &#8220;I go
to the sepulcher,&#8221; she said, and slipped hastily out
of the door&mdash;to confront Eli.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>It was a pale and scandalized Eli, but he spoke
quietly: &#8220;I will go with thee, for doth not my mother
lie there also?&#8221;</p>

<p>Halfway down the hill they met Isaac and Benjamin
in earnest conversation. Isaac intercepted
the pair: &#8220;The caravan is ready. The start awaiteth
thy pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In an hour,&#8221; Eli returned, briefly, but Miriam
answered not at all, nor even raised her eyes.</p>

<p>As they plodded on, Isaac turned sadly to Benjamin:
&#8220;I fear my question is already answered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin put a sympathetic hand upon his shoulder.
&#8220;Then for many reasons would I be sorry,&#8221;
he declared, &#8220;yet peradventure the maiden&#8217;s mistress
will not let her make such a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not until they neared their destination did Eli
speak to Miriam, then he burst forth with a vehemence
which awed her: &#8220;Could <i>he</i> come with thee
to this sacred place? Canst thou share thy holiest
memories with him? Nay, for well thou knowest
that our two mothers lie here because of the wounds
he inflicted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say rather &#8216;the wounds of war,&#8217; Eli. Isaac hath
repented of his part and hath made such restitution
as he could. Should we count it as naught? I think
our mothers would forgive, and doth not our Law
require it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eli continued as if he had not heard: &#8220;Tidings
did I hear in the camp that thy mistress was to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
thee to him in marriage, but because thou hast filled
my heart did I believe I was in thine. I did not know
thou wouldst prefer the servant of the rich man,
who hath manners which belong to a king&#8217;s court,
who is clothed in fine linen and fareth sumptuously
every day. I thought not thou wouldst despise the
preacher of Jehovah, whose lot will be a far country
and coarse apparel and scanty food and the contempt
and ridicule of the multitude. Thou didst tell me
that it was duty which called thee to Damascus. I
have just learned that it was the voice of thy beloved.
Nor would I have believed had I not heard from
thine own lips through the open door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miriam lifted her head a trifle defiantly. &#8220;What
thou sayest is as if it were in an unknown tongue.
The tidings thou hast heard have not reached mine
ears, nor can it be true when well I know that it
would not be to his liking.&#8221; Her tones were bitter.
The poison of Lemuel&#8217;s remarks was still at
work.</p>

<p>She went on more calmly: &#8220;Never have I thought
of Isaac as thou hast described him but only as the
friend in whom I could safely trust, who was never
amused like my mistress nor impatient like Milcah
nor indifferent like everyone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But friendship is not love, Miriam. Thou must
not think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he took her in his arms. &#8220;Thou art
mine,&#8221; he cried, fiercely. &#8220;Long ago thy mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
gave thee to me. Neither Isaac nor any man shall
take thee from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a long, sobbing breath, gazing at her
with a face so full of tragic sorrow she was appalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe thee so much&mdash;so much, Eli,&#8221; she whispered,
contritely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall not <i>take</i> thee,&#8221; repeated the young man,
&#8220;but I shall go with thee to Damascus to preach the
word of Jehovah as we have said, and when the
time cometh I will <i>give</i> thee to him if it pleaseth
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Releasing her not urgently he strode away. She
stood still for a moment, then she called after him,
her voice sweetly compassionate. She begged him
to tarry, but he seemed not to hear, and after a little
she followed him to the sleeping place of the dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not a cheerful party which started that day
to Syria. Farewell tears were thinly veiled under
encouraging smiles. Miriam was so obviously considerate
for Eli that Isaac was plunged into the
depths of despondency. Eli himself seemed lost in
painful reverie. Nathan, obliged to ride the horse
Lemuel had not had opportunity to take, loudly bewailed
his own better steed, while the soldier-escort,
under its breath, cursed the merciless rays of the
sun.</p>

<p>Hour after hour they journeyed. Through dim
eyes Miriam beheld a fleeting picture of the hilltop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
villages and scattered groves of her beloved Israel.
Here and there they passed other travelers and infrequent
beggars. Once, the chariot in which
Miriam and her two maid servants were riding came
to a sudden halt. Apparently there was some obstruction
in the road ahead. A leper, hurrying
away, was yet near enough for her to look upon his
repulsive countenance. Shuddering, she turned to
see if Eli or Nathan had noticed, but they were busy
helping the soldiers conceal a loathsome something
with a light covering of earth. The leper was Gehazi!</p>

<p>Isaac rode up with an explanatory word. He
pointed to the mound: &#8220;It is the deserter, Lemuel.
Some wild beast hath met him at night while he slept
and where there was none to help. The body is
gnawed and broken, but there can be no mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nathan called excitedly and Isaac responded at
once. A little later they returned with Nathan&#8217;s
own horse, which had broken his halter&mdash;doubtless
through fright&mdash;and roamed at will until reclaimed
by his master. For half an hour Miriam listened
indulgently to the boy&#8217;s enthusiastic recital of the
capture and the steed&#8217;s wonders, then Nathan took
a place in the rear. They descended the hot gorge
in which roared the Jordan, crossed its foaming
waters, emerged into the freer air of the uplands
and so to the main-traveled roads leading north.
Nathan was again beside Miriam.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;I have been watching the party for hours,&#8221; he
declared with a boisterous laugh. &#8220;Funny how it
rides. The soldiers plod along silently, sometimes
jesting or quarreling. Obeying is their business.
Never once hath Eli turned his head. Already he
seeth himself a prophet of the Lord in the strange
land toward which he goeth. But ever Isaac watcheth
thee, and always thine eyes are turned toward
Eli.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they resumed their journey after the noon-time
rest it was Isaac who rode beside the chariot. He
put into her hands a piece of sheepskin, folded protectingly
over something evidently very precious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;when thou wert but a
little maid and knewest not the meaning of such
things, I bound these damson blossoms upon my
heart in token of loving devotion to thee. They
have withered, but that for which they stood has
never died. I cannot suppose&#8221;&mdash;with an involuntary
glance at Eli&mdash;&#8220;that thou wilt treasure them as I
have, but it is thy right to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer he dropped back
to his old position. A long time Miriam stared at
the blossoms, then, with tenderest care she folded
them in their sheepskin covering and put them in
her bosom. He was at her side instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou dost not count them as naught, Miriam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love is not friendship, Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thrill he had experienced suddenly died. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
was a moment before he could answer in the old,
matter-of-fact way. &#8220;Then it were only selfishness,
Miriam. If it be not friendship, then it is not love
either, for love is friendship intensified, glorified.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent. After some hesitancy he spoke
again, this time with quiet determination and in the
speech of Israel, which they had used before so that
the maid servants might not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hour hath come, Miriam, when I must tell
thee what thy mistress hath said and ask thee for
the truth.&#8221; He told her briefly the plans Adah had
outlined to him.</p>

<p>She made no comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But because thou wert free in Israel and but a
servant in Syria I have wondered if thou art sacrificing
thyself to give advantages to Eli.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was very faint. &#8220;Nay, Isaac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy sense of duty is strong, Miriam, and thou
art necessary to the happiness of the household in
Damascus, yet because thou hast cherished the token
which hath meant so much to me I almost thought&mdash;peradventure
because I so wished it might be&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not speak for so long that he peered under
the awning, beholding a face that crimsoned as it
looked into his and in the eyes a something which
lit his own with rapturous hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not be content to be free when thou wert
still in bondage, Isaac.&#8221; The tones were very low,
very sweet, very hesitant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;Miriam,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;thou canst not mean&mdash;thou
dost not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But evidently she did, for the two maid servants
exchanged smiles and meaning glances, and he continued
to ride beside the chariot while they drew near
to Damascus and the glad welcome of the House of
Naaman.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
